L.; Tabei, A.; Lange, Y.']","the cholesterol affinities of many integral plasma membrane proteins have been estimated by molecular computation. however, these values lack experimental confirmation. we therefore developed a simple mathematical model to extract sterol affinity constants and stoichiometries from published isotherms for the dependence of the activity of such proteins on membrane cholesterol concentration. the binding curves for these proteins are sigmoidal with strongly-lagged thresholds attributable to competition for the cholesterol by bilayer phospholipids. the model provided isotherms that matched the experimental data using published values for the sterol association constants and stoichiometries of the phospholipids. three oligomeric transporters were found to bind cholesterol without cooperativity with dimensionless association constants of 35 for kir3.4* and 100 for both kir2 and a gat transporter. (the corresponding {rho}g{degrees} values were -8.8, -11.4 and -11.4 kj/mol, respectively.) these association constants are significantly lower than those for the phospholipids which range from [~]100 to 6,000. the bk channel, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the m192i mutant of kir3.4* appear to bind multiple cholesterol molecules cooperatively (n = 2 or 4) with subunit affinities of 563, 950 and 700, respectively. the model predicts that the three less avid transporters are approximately half-saturated in their native plasma membranes; hence, sensitive to variations in cholesterol in vivo. the more avid proteins would be nearly saturated in vivo. the method can be applied to any integral protein or other ligand in any bilayer for which there are reasonable estimates of the sterol affinities and stoichiometries of the phospholipids."

C.; Dilthey, A. T.; Klau, G.

M.; Albert, R.; Rozum, J. C.']","a common feature of complex systems is their ability to balance the flexibility needed to adapt to their environment with the rigidity required for robust function. it has been conjectured that living systems accomplish this by existing at the ""edge of chaos"", i.e., the critical boundary between ordered and disordered dynamics. simple toy models of gene regulatory networks lend support to this idea, and mathematical tools developed for these toy models yield similar results when applied to experimentally-supported models of specific cellular regulatory mechanisms (functional modules). here, however, we demonstrate that a deeper inspection of 72 experimentally-supported discrete dynamical models of functional modules reveals previously unobserved order in these systems on long time scales, suggesting greater rigidity in these systems than was previously conjectured. our analysis relies on new measures that quantify the tendency of perturbations to spread through a discrete dynamical system. a benefit of our new approach is that it accounts for how system trajectories are mapped to phenotypes in practice. because these measures are computationally expensive to estimate, existing tools were insufficient for the ensemble of models considered here. to simulate the tens of millions of trajectories required for convergence, we developed a multipurpose cuda-based simulation tool, which we have made available as the open-source python library cubewalkers. we find that in experimentally-supported models of biomolecular functional modules, perturbation propagation is more transitory than previously thought, and that even in cases where large perturbation cascades persist, their phenotypic effects are often minimal. moreover, by examining the impact of update scheme on experimentally-supported models, we find evidence that stochasticity and desynchronization can lead to increased recovery from regulatory perturbation cascades in functional modules and uncover previously unreported population-level robustness to even timing perturbations in these systems. we identify specific biological mechanisms underlying these dynamical behaviors and highlight them in experimentally-supported regulatory networks from the systems biology literature. based on novel measures and simulations, our results suggest that-contrary to current theory-functional modules of biological systems are ordered and far from the edge of chaos."

(4). we synthesized aspirin nhs ester (aspirin-nhs) to capitalize on this versatility in acetylating biomolecules. this tailored approach allows for the selective targeting of lysine residues within proteins, offering a specific tool to examine the functional consequences of lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. for this study, a model protein system was used. we selected β-conglycinin, a soy protein, that offers a pragmatic platform for investigating lysine acetylation within the nf-κb complex. β-conglycinin is rich in lysine residues, similar to nf-κb, making it homologous to this line of inquiry (5). we can examine the theoretical considerations of lysine acetylation with practical experimental observations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory dynamics within the nf-κb complex. this research contributes not only to the expanding toolkit for precise protein acetylation modulation but also enhances our understanding of nf-κb's regulatory dynamics in the context of cancer, establishing a bridge between chemical synthesis and biological investigation.

Andrews Jonathan Li Brent C. Melot Johanna Nelson Weker Kimberly A. See,"new energy storage methods are emerging to increase the energy density of the state-of-the-art battery systems beyond the conventional intercalation electrode materials. for instance, employing anion redox can yield higher capacities compared to transition metal redox alone. anion redox in sulfides has been recognized since the early days of rechargeable battery research. however, now we aim to understand the charge compensation mechanisms and how to control them. here, we study the effect of d-p overlap in controlling anion redox by shifting the metal d band position relative to the s p band. we aim to determine the effect of shifting the d band position on the electronic structure and ultimately on charge compensation. two isostructural sulfides linafes2 and linacos2 are directly compared with the hypothesis that the co material should yield more covalent metal-anion bonds. the newly reported material linacos2 exhibits multielectron capacity of >/=1.7 electrons per formula unit, but despite the lowered co d band, the voltage of anion redox is close to that of linafes2. interestingly, the material suffers from rapid capacity fade. through a combination of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, co and s x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, and partial density of states calculations, we demonstrate that s oxidation to [s2]2- occurs in early states of charge which leads to an irreversible phase transition into pyrite cos2 and lithiated cobalt spinel phases such as lixco3s4 and lixco9s8. thus, we conclude that anion oxidation occurs from s nonbonding p orbitals and the co d bands are too low in energy to prevent a phase transition to more thermodynamically stable persulfide-containing phases. further, the higher crystal field stabilization energy for octahedral coordination over tetrahedral coordination leads to phase transition in linacos2."

Applied to Kilonovae (KNe) associated with neutron stars mergers and Type Ia supernovae, our semi-analytic and analytic approximations reproduce, with a few percent and 10% accuracy, respectively, the energy deposition rates, $\dot{Q}_\text{dep}$, obtained in numeric Monte Carlo calculations. The time $t_γ$ beyond which $γ$-ray deposition is inefficient is determined by an effective frequency-independent $γ$-ray opacity $κ_{γ,\text{eff}}$, $t_γ= \sqrt{κ_{γ,\text{eff}}\langleΣ\rangle t^2}$, where $\langleΣ\rangle\propto t^{-2}$ is the average plasma column density. For $β$-decay dominated energy release, $κ_{γ,\text{eff}}$ is typically close to the effective Compton scattering opacity, $κ_{γ,\text{eff}} \approx 0.025~{\rm {cm}^{2}\,g^{-1}}$ with a weak dependence on composition.

Many individual reactions in metabolism entail slightly endergonic processes that are coupled to free energy release, typically as ATP hydrolysis, in order to go forward. ATP is almost always supplied by the rotor-stator ATP synthetase (the ATPase), which harnesses chemiosmotic ion gradients. Because the ATPase is a protein, it arose after the ribosome did. Here we address two questions using comparative physiology: What was the energy currency of metabolism before the origin of the ATPase? How (and why) did ATP come to be the universal energy currency? About 27 percent of a cell's energy budget is consumed as GTP during translation. The universality of GTP-dependence in ribosome function indicates that GTP was the ancestral energy currency of protein synthesis. The use of GTP in translation and ATP in small molecule synthesis are conserved across all lineages, representing energetic compartments that arose in the last universal common ancestor, LUCA."

We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either inflationary Affleck-Dine mechanism or spontaneous leptogenesis thanks to the PQ-number asymmetry, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter can be purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution only with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves are expected to have information about some masse parameters of the left-handed and the right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by at least a long-lived right-handed neutrino species."

Unlike conventional methods deploying passive RIS on UAVs, this study delves into the efficacy of an aerial active RIS (AARIS). Specifically, the downlink transmission of an AARIS network is investigated, where the base station (BS) leverages rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) for effective interference management and benefits from the support of an AARIS for jointly amplifying and reflecting the BS's transmit signals. Considering both the non-trivial energy consumption of the active RIS and the limited energy storage of the UAV, we propose an innovative element selection strategy for optimizing the on/off status of RIS elements, which adaptively and remarkably manages the system's power consumption. To this end, a resource management problem is formulated, aiming to maximize the system energy efficiency (EE) by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BS, the element activation, the phase shift and the amplification factor at the RIS, the RSMA common data rate at users, as well as the UAV's trajectory. Due to the dynamicity nature of UAV and user mobility, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for resource allocation, utilizing meta-learning to adaptively handle fast time-varying system dynamics. Simulations indicate that incorporating an active RIS at the UAV leads to substantial EE gain, compared to passive RIS-aided UAV. We observe the superiority of the RSMA-based AARIS system in terms of EE, compared to existing approaches adopting non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)."

However, when mediators are missing in the population where the effect is to be transported, these estimates could be biased. We study this issue of missing mediators, motivated by challenges in public health, wherein mediators can be missing, not at random. We propose a sensitivity analysis framework that quantifies the impact of missing mediator data on transported mediation effects. This framework enables us to identify the settings under which the conditional transported mediation effect is rendered insignificant for the subgroup with missing mediator data. Specifically, we provide the bounds on the transported mediation effect as a function of missingness. We then apply the framework to longitudinal data from the Moving to Opportunity Study, a large-scale housing voucher experiment, to quantify the effect of missing mediators on transport effect estimates of voucher receipt, an upstream intervention on living location, in childhood on subsequent risk of mental health or substance use disorder mediated through parental health across sites. Our findings provide a tangible understanding of how much missing data can be withstood for unbiased effect estimates."

Traditional spreading models often assume individuals play the same role in the spreading process. In reality, however, individuals' diverse characteristics contribute differently to the spreading performance, leading to a heterogeneous infection rate across the system. To investigate network spreading dynamics under heterogeneous infection rates, we integrate two individual-level features -- influence (i.e., the ability to influence neighbors) and susceptibility (i.e., the extent to be influenced by neighbors) -- into the independent cascade model. Our findings reveal significant differences in spreading performance under heterogeneous and constant infection rates, with traditional structural centrality metrics proving more effective in the latter scenario. Additionally, we take the constant and heterogeneous infection rates into a state-of-the-art maximization algorithm, the well-known TIM algorithm, and find the seeds selected by heterogeneous infection rates are more dispersed compared to those under constant rates. Lastly, we find that both individuals' influence and susceptibility are vital to the spreading performance. Strikingly, susceptible individuals are particularly important to spreading when information is disseminated by social celebrities. By integrating influence and susceptibility into the spreading model, we gain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving information spreading."

Such tasks typically require multi-hop reasoning, i.e., match natural language utterance with instances in the environment. Previous methods leverage LLMs to incrementally build a reasoning path, where the LLMs either invoke tools or pick up schemas by step-by-step interacting with the environment. We propose Reasoning-Path-Editing (Readi), a novel framework where LLMs can efficiently and faithfully reason over structured environments. In Readi, LLMs initially generate a reasoning path given a query, and edit the path only when necessary. We instantiate the path on structured environments and provide feedback to edit the path if anything goes wrong. Experimental results on three KGQA datasets and two TableQA datasets show the effectiveness of Readi, significantly surpassing all LLM-based methods (by 9.1% on WebQSP, 12.4% on MQA-3H and 10.9% on WTQ), comparable with state-of-the-art fine-tuned methods (67% on CWQ and 74.7% on WebQSP) and substantially boosting the vanilla LLMs (by 14.9% on CWQ).

Guertin', 'Bernard Candas', 'Caroline Sirois', 'Denis Talbot']","Marginal structural models have been increasingly used by analysts in recent years to account for confounding bias in studies with time-varying treatments. The parameters of these models are often estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting. To ensure that the estimated weights adequately control confounding, it is possible to check for residual imbalance between treatment groups in the weighted data. Several balance metrics have been developed and compared in the cross-sectional case but have not yet been evaluated and compared in longitudinal studies with time-varying treatment. We have first extended the definition of several balance metrics to the case of a time-varying treatment, with or without censoring. We then compared the performance of these balance metrics in a simulation study by assessing the strength of the association between their estimated level of imbalance and bias. We found that the Mahalanobis balance performed best.Finally, the method was illustrated for estimating the cumulative effect of statins exposure over one year on the risk of cardiovascular disease or death in people aged 65 and over in population-wide administrative data. This illustration confirms the feasibility of employing our proposed metrics in large databases with multiple time-points."

If the disconnecting process is too slow, the coupling between the battery and the bath weakens, and at some point, the battery will be in a thermal state that can not be used as a battery. Thus, the unitarily extractable energy (a.k.a ergotropy) decreases with the disconnection time. The work required to disconnect the battery also depends on the disconnection time. We study the efficiency of this battery, defined as the ratio between the ergotropy to the work cost of disconnecting and connecting the battery back to the bath to close the cycle, as a function of the disconnecting time in the Caldeira-Leggett model of a quantum battery. We consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, we assume that the discharged battery is uncorrelated to the bath at the connecting time and find that the efficiency peaks at an optimal disconnecting time. In the second scenario, the discharged battery is correlated to the bath, and find that the optimal efficiency corresponds to an instantaneous disconnection. On top of these results, we analyze various thermodynamic quantities for these Caldeira-Leggett quantum batteries that allow us to express the first and second laws of thermodynamics in the mentioned cycles in simple form despite the system-bath initial correlations and strong coupling regime of the working device."

We define this form of chemical-based neural network as Wet TinyML. The GRNN structures are based on the gene regulatory network and have weights associated with each link based on the estimated interactions between the genes. The GRNNs can be used for conventional computing by employing an application-based search process similar to the Network Architecture Search. This study advances this concept by incorporating cell plasticity, to further exploit natural cell's adaptability, in order to diversify the GRNN search that can match larger spectrum as well as dynamic computing tasks. As an example application, we show that through the directed cell plasticity, we can extract the mathematical regression evolution enabling it to match to dynamic system applications. We also conduct energy analysis by comparing the chemical energy of the GRNN to its silicon counterpart, where this analysis includes both artificial neural network algorithms executed on von Neumann architecture as well as neuromorphic processors. The concept of Wet TinyML can pave the way for the new emergence of chemical-based, energy-efficient and miniature Biological AI."

Raymond', 'Guillaume Avice', 'Matthew S. Clement']","Recent models of solar system formation suggest that a dynamical instability among the giant planets happened within the first 100 Myr after disk dispersal, perhaps before the Moon-forming impact. As a direct consequence, a bombardment of volatile-rich impactors may have taken place on Earth before internal and atmospheric reservoirs were decoupled. However, such a timing has been interpreted to potentially be at odds with the disparate inventories of Xe isotopes in Earth's mantle compared to its atmosphere. This study aims to assess the dynamical effects of an Early Instability on the delivery of carbonaceous asteroids and comets to Earth, and address the implications for the Earth's volatile budget. We perform 20 high-resolution dynamical simulations of solar system formation from the time of gas disk dispersal, each starting with 1600 carbonaceous asteroids and 10000 comets, taking into account the dynamical perturbations from an early giant planet instability. Before the Moon-forming impact, the cumulative collision rate of comets with Earth is about 4 orders of magnitude lower than that of carbonaceous asteroids. After the Moon-forming impact, this ratio either decreases or increases, often by orders of magnitude, depending on the dynamics of individual simulations. An increase in the relative contribution of comets happens in 30\% of our simulations. In these cases, the delivery of noble gases from each source is comparable, given that the abundance of 132Xe is 3 orders of magnitude greater in comets than in carbonaceous chondrites. The increase in cometary flux relative to carbonaceous asteroids at late times may thus offer an explanation for the Xe signature dichotomy between the Earth's mantle and atmosphere."

This restriction leads to a partial theta function with a combinatoric interpretation in terms of Dyson's crank of a partition. More crucially, this partition function can be expressed in terms of a q-hypergeometric function with quantum modular properties. This allows us to find its high-temperature asymptotics, including subleading terms which agree with, but also go beyond, what one obtains by imposing neutrality thermodynamically through a chemical potential. We evaluate the asymptotic density of states for this neutral partition function, including the first few subleading terms.

Traditional reconstruction methods are generally for two-dimensional (2D) spectrum map and driven by abundant sampling data. In this paper, we propose a data-model-knowledge-driven reconstruction scheme to construct the three-dimensional (3D) spectrum map under multi-radiation source scenarios. We firstly design a maximum and minimum path loss difference (MMPLD) clustering algorithm to detect the number of radiation sources in a 3D space. Then, we develop a joint location-power estimation method based on the heuristic population evolutionary optimization algorithm. Considering the variation of electromagnetic environment, we self-learn the path loss (PL) model based on the sampling data. Finally, the 3D spectrum is reconstructed according to the self-learned PL model and the extracted knowledge of radiation sources. Simulations show that the proposed 3D spectrum map reconstruction scheme not only has splendid adaptability to the environment, but also achieves high spectrum construction accuracy even when the sampling rate is very low."

This proof-of-concept coupling between light and mechanical mode shape significantly broadens the optomechanical design space.

Our work builds up on the framework of 3D Gaussian splatting. For a given scene, we take the pretrained Gaussians and process them using a multi resolution hash grid and a tiny MLP to obtain the conditional stylised views. The explicit nature of 3D Gaussians give us inherent advantages over NeRF-based methods including geometric consistency, along with having a fast training and rendering regime.

Their properties only depend on the constituting material, the size and shape of the nano-object as well as its surrounding medium. In anisotropic structures, such as metallic nanorods, two families of modes generally exist, transverse and longitudinal. Their spectral and spatial overlaps usually impede their separate measurements in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). In this work, we propose three different strategies enabling to overcome this difficulty and selectively probe longitudinal and transverse modes. The first strategy is numeric and relies on morphing of nano-structures, rooted in the geometrical nature of LSPs. The two other strategies exploit the relativistic and wave nature of the electrons in an EELS experiment. The first one is the phase-matching between the electron and the plasmon excitation to enhance their coupling by either tilting the sample and modifying the electron kinetic energy. The second one - polarized EELS (pEELS) - exploits the wave nature of electrons to mimic selection rules analogous to the one existing in light spectroscopies. The above-mentioned strategies are exemplified - either experimentally or numerically - on a canonical plasmonic toy model: the nano-rod. The goal of the paper is to bring together the state-of-the-art concepts of EELS for plasmonics to tackle a pedestrian problem in this field."

Here, we report experimental evidence of a universal feature in the patterns of flow that spontaneously emerges in groups of collectively moving cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that the flows generated by collectively moving dog kidney cells, human breast cancer cells, and by two different strains of pathogenic bacteria, all exhibit conformal invariance. Remarkably, not only do our results show that all of these very different systems display robust conformal invariance, but we also discovered that the precise form of the invariance in all four systems is described by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE), and belongs to the percolation universality class. A continuum model of active matter can recapitulate both the observed conformal invariance and SLE form found in experiments. The presence of universal conformal invariance reveals that the macroscopic features of living biological matter exhibit universal translational, rotational, and scale symmetries that are independent of the microscopic properties of its constituents. Our results show that the patterns of flows generated by diverse cellular systems are highly conserved and that biological systems can unexpectedly be used to experimentally test predictions from the theories for conformally invariant structures"

Here, we use the Fermi-Hubbard model to study HHG from a linear chain of atoms. This model allows us to study both the correlated and uncorrelated phases through a specification of the amount of onsite electron-electron repulsion.

According to our observation, dialogue contexts are highly structured, and the special token of \textit{End-of-Utterance} (EoU) in dialogues has the potential to aggregate information. We refer to the EoU tokens as ``conversational attention sinks'' (conv-attn sinks). Accordingly, we introduce StreamingDialogue, which compresses long dialogue history into conv-attn sinks with minimal losses, and thus reduces computational complexity quadratically with the number of sinks (i.e., the number of utterances). Current LLMs already demonstrate the ability to handle long context window, e.g., a window size of 200k or more. To this end, by compressing utterances into EoUs, our method has the potential to handle more than 200k of utterances, resulting in a prolonged dialogue learning. In order to minimize information losses from reconstruction after compression, we design two learning strategies of short-memory reconstruction (SMR) and long-memory reactivation (LMR).

Our results show that there is an excess in the ultraviolet spectrum in most quiescent galaxies (compared to the expectations from models fitting their optical/infrared colors and spectra) below $z\sim0.6$, beyond which the excess UV emission fades rapidly. This evolution of the UV color is only consistent with the presence of a highly evolved, hot horizontal branch sub-population in these galaxies (amongst the majority cool and optically bright stars), comprising on average 10\% of the total stellar mass and forming at $z>3$. The blue UV colors of early-type galaxies at low-intermediate redshifts are likely driven by this sub-population being enriched in helium up to $\sim44\%$. At $z>0.8$ (when the extra UV component has not yet appeared) the data allows us to constrain the star formation histories of galaxies by fitting models to the evolution of their UV colors: we find that the epoch at which the stellar populations formed ranges between $3<z_{form}<10$ (corresponding to $0.5-2.2$ Gyrs after the Big Bang) with a star-formation e-folding timescale of $τ=0.35-0.7$ Gyr, suggesting that these galaxies formed the majority of stars at very high redshift, with a brief yet intense burst of star-formation activity. The star formation history and chemical evolution of early-type galaxies resemble those of globular clusters, albeit on much larger scales."

In contrast to nuclear spins, such as noble-gas spins, which experience minimal polarization loss at cell walls, atomic spins in uncoated cells undergo randomization at the boundaries. This distinct boundary condition results in a varied dependence of the relaxation rate on the field gradient. By solving the Bloch-Torrey equation under fully depolarizing boundary conditions, we illustrate that the relaxation rate induced by field inhomogeneity is more pronounced for spins with a smaller original relaxation rate (in the absence of the inhomogeneous field). We establish an upper limit for the relaxation rate through calculations in the perturbation regime. Moreover, we connect it to the spin-exchange-relaxation-free magnetometers, demonstrating that its linewidth is most sensitive to inhomogeneous fields along the magnetometer's sensitive axis. Our theoretical result agrees with the experimental data for cells subjected to small pump power. However, deviations in larger input-power scenarios underscore the importance of considering pump field attenuation, which leads to uniformly distributed light shift that behaves as an inhomogeneous magnetic field."

Traditional contact measurement methods have some limitations, while emerging non-contact image processing technology shows good application prospects. This paper proposes a container dynamic liquid level detection model based on U^2-Net. This model uses the SAM model to generate an initial data set, and then evaluates and filters out high-quality pseudo-label images through the SemiReward framework to build an exclusive data set. The model uses U^2-Net to extract mask images of containers from the data set, and uses morphological processing to compensate for mask defects. Subsequently, the model calculates the grayscale difference between adjacent video frame images at the same position, segments the liquid level change area by setting a difference threshold, and finally uses a lightweight neural network to classify the liquid level state. This approach not only mitigates the impact of intricate surroundings, but also reduces the demand for training data, showing strong robustness and versatility. A large number of experimental results show that the proposed model can effectively detect the dynamic liquid level changes of the liquid in the container, providing a novel and efficient solution for related fields."

Unfortunately, there is no existing method that tailors for automatic manga screening, probably due to the difficulty of generating high-quality shaded high-frequency screentones. The classic manga screening approaches generally require user input to provide screentone exemplars or a reference manga image. The recent deep learning models enables the automatic generation by learning from a large-scale dataset. However, the state-of-the-art models still fail to generate high-quality shaded screentones due to the lack of a tailored model and high-quality manga training data. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch-to-manga framework that first generates a color illustration from the sketch and then generates a screentoned manga based on the intensity guidance. Our method significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality manga with shaded high-frequency screentones."

In this paper, we propose the first generative agent architecture that empowers the emergence of social norms within a population of large language model-based agents. Our architecture, named CRSEC, consists of four modules: Creation & Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. Our architecture addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within large language model-based multi-agent systems. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach."

We introduce the indexes of the velocity field flow based on the zero modes of the velocity field and find that these zero modes play the role of effective topological charges or defects linking to Euler characteristic by the Poincaré-Hopf theorem. The global property of the indexes is topological invariants against the parameter deformation. We demonstrate this approach by the quantum torus model and compare the topological invariant with that obtained from the Chern number. We find that the physical mechanism of the topological invariant based on the zero modes of the velocity field is different from that of the topological invariant by the Chern number. The topological invariant characterized by the velocity field describes a homeomorphic topological invariant associated with the zero modes on the submanifold of the base manifold of the SU(2)-fibre bundle for quantum torus, whereas the Chern number characterizes a homotopy invariant associated with the exceptional points in the Brillouin zone. We also propose the generalized winding number in terms of the velocity field for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian systems. This gives a connection between the zero mode and winding number in the velocity space. These results enrich the topological invariants of quantum states and promises us a novel insight to understanding topological invariants of quantum states as well as expected to be further applied in more generic models."

In this paper, we investigate the dispersion behavior of chiral microswimmers in a simple shear flow utilizing the generalized Taylor dispersion (GTD) theory, motivated by biased locomotion of bacterial swimmers known as bacterial rheotaxis. We thus focus on the influence of shear-induced torque effects due to particle chirality, employing an extended Jeffery equation for individual deterministic dynamics. We then numerically calculate macroscopic parameters including averaged swimming velocity and effective diffusion tensor using spherical harmonic expansion, and argue the obtained results based on the fixed points and their stability of the orientational dynamical systems. Our results reveal that chiral effects induce biased locomotion and we observe qualitative transitions in the orientational distribution with increasing Peclét number, aligning with previous experimental findings. The diffusion tensor analysis highlights significant reduction in the diffusion coefficient perpendicular to the flow plane due to chirality. This suggests potential applications in flow-mediated cell separation and we numerically demonstrate such chirality-induced fluid transportation. The presented methods will be useful in predicting and controlling dispersion behaviors of such chiral microswimmers."

Sun', 'Chang-Beom Eom', 'Paul G. Evans', 'Jia-Mian Hu']","Terahertz (THz) spin waves or their quanta, magnons, can be efficiently excited by acoustic phonons because these excitations have similar wavevectors in the THz regime. THz acoustic phonons can be produced using photoacoustic phenomena but typically have a low population and thus a relatively low displacement amplitude. The magnetization amplitude and population of the acoustically excited THz magnons are thus usually small. Using analytical calculations and dynamical phase-field simulations, we show that a freestanding metal/magnetic-insulator (MI)/dielectric multilayer can be designed to produce large-amplitude THz spin wave via cavity-enhanced magnon-phonon interaction. The amplitude of the acoustically excited THz spin wave in the freestanding multilayer is predicted to be more than ten times larger than in a substrate-supported multilayer. Acoustically excited nonlinear magnon-magnon interaction is demonstrated in the freestanding multilayer. The simulations also indicate that the magnon modes can be detected by probing the charge current in the metal layer generated via spin-charge conversion across the MI/metal interface and the resulting THz radiation. Applications of the freestanding multilayer in THz optoelectronic transduction are computationally demonstrated."

However, current pre-training frameworks are limited to two modalities, and designing a unified network to process different modalities (e.g., natural language, 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecular conformations, and 3D proteins) remains challenging due to inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose MolBind, a framework that trains encoders for multiple modalities through contrastive learning, mapping all modalities to a shared feature space for multi-modal semantic alignment. To facilitate effective pre-training of MolBind on multiple modalities, we also build and collect a high-quality dataset with four modalities, MolBind-M4, including graph-language, conformation-language, graph-conformation, and conformation-protein paired data. MolBind shows superior zero-shot learning performance across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating its strong capability of capturing the underlying semantics of multiple modalities."

The photospheric spectra are dominated by broad He I and Ca NIR emission lines with velocities of $\sim10\ 000 - 12\ 000$ $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The late-time spectra show prominent narrow He I emission lines at $\sim$1000$\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$, indicative of interaction with He-rich circumstellar material. SN 2023zaw is located in the spiral arm of a star-forming galaxy. We perform radiation-hydrodynamical and analytical modeling of the lightcurve by fitting with a combination of shock-cooling emission and nickel decay. The progenitor has a best-fit envelope mass of $\approx0.2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and an envelope radius of $\approx50$ $\mathrm{R_\odot}$. The extremely low nickel mass and low ejecta mass ($\approx0.5$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) suggest an ultra-stripped SN, which originates from a mass-losing low mass He-star (ZAMS mass $<$ 10 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) in a close binary system. This is a channel to form double neutron star systems, whose merger is detectable with LIGO. SN 2023zaw underscores the existence of a previously undiscovered population of extremely low nickel mass ($< 0.005$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$) stripped-envelope supernovae, which can be explored with deep and high-cadence transient surveys."

Towards Assessing Fairness of Privacy Policies,"['Vincent Freiberger', 'Erik Buchmann']","Privacy policies are expected to inform data subjects about their data protection rights. They should explain the data controller's data management practices, and make facts such as retention periods or data transfers to third parties transparent. Privacy policies only fulfill their purpose, if they are correctly perceived, interpreted, understood, and trusted by the data subject. Amongst others, this requires that a privacy policy is written in a fair way, e.g., it does not use polarizing terms, does not require a certain education, or does not assume a particular social background. In this work-in-progress paper, we outline our approach to assessing fairness in privacy policies. To this end, we identify from fundamental legal sources and fairness research, how the dimensions informational fairness, representational fairness and ethics/morality are related to privacy policies. We propose options to automatically assess policies in these fairness dimensions, based on text statistics, linguistic methods and artificial intelligence. Finally, we conduct initial experiments with German privacy policies to provide evidence that our approach is applicable. Our experiments indicate that there are indeed issues in all three dimensions of fairness. For example, our approach finds out if a policy discriminates against individuals with impaired reading skills or certain demographics, and identifies questionable ethics. This is important, as future privacy policies may be used in a corpus for legal artificial intelligence models."

Dey', 'Aman Timalsina', 'Cheng Xin']","For a $P$-indexed persistence module ${\sf M}$, the (generalized) rank of ${\sf M}$ is defined as the rank of the limit-to-colimit map for ${\sf M}$ over the poset $P$. For $2$-parameter persistence modules, recently a zigzag persistence based algorithm has been proposed that takes advantage of the fact that generalized rank for $2$-parameter modules is equal to the number of full intervals in a zigzag module defined on the boundary of the poset. Analogous definition of boundary for $d$-parameter persistence modules or general $P$-indexed persistence modules does not seem plausible. To overcome this difficulty, we first unfold a given $P$-indexed module ${\sf M}$ into a zigzag module ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ and then check how many full interval modules in a decomposition of ${\sf M}_{ZZ}$ can be folded back to remain full in ${\sf M}$. This number determines the generalized rank of ${\sf M}$. For special cases of degree-$d$ homology for $d$-complexes, we obtain a more efficient algorithm including a linear time algorithm for degree-$1$ homology in graphs."

Tähtinen', 'A. R. Yeates']","The Sun experienced a period of unprecedented activity during the 20th century, now called the Modern Maximum (MM). The decay of the MM after cycle 19 has changed the Sun, the heliosphere, and the planetary environments in many ways. However, studies disagree on whether this decay has proceeded synchronously in different solar parameters or not. One key issue is if the relation between two long parameters of solar activity, the sunspot number and the solar 10.7cm radio flux, has remained the same during this decay. A recent study argues that there is an inhomogeneity in the 10.7cm radio flux in 1980, which leads to a step-like jump (""1980 jump"") in this relation. Here we show that the relation between sunspot number and 10.7cm radio flux varies in time, not due to an inhomogeneous radio flux but due to physical changes in the solar atmosphere. We used radio fluxes at four different wavelengths measured in Japan, and studied their long-term relation with the sunspot number and the 10.7cm radio flux. We also used two other solar parameters, the MgII index and the number of active regions. We find that the 1980 jump is only the first of a series of 1-2-year ""humps"" that mainly occur during solar maxima. All radio fluxes increase with respect to the sunspot number from the 1970s to 2010s. These results reestablish the 10.7cm flux as a homogeneous measure of solar activity. The fluxes of the longer radio waves are found to increase with respect to the shorter waves, which suggests a long-term change in the solar radio spectrum. We also find that the MgII index and the number of active regions also increased with respect to the sunspot number, further verifying the difference in the long-term evolution in chromospheric and photospheric parameters. Our results provide evidence for important structural changes in solar magnetic fields and the solar atmosphere during the decay of the MM."

Existing epidemiological models, specifically compartmental models, aimed to predict the spread of the COVID-19 virus and its impact on the population, but they overlooked the influence of \ac{VH} on disease dynamics, including the expected number of hospitalizations and fatalities. We propose improvements to the \ac{SEIR} model for COVID-19 by incorporating the influence of vaccination, \ac{VH}, and resource availability on the disease dynamics. We collect publicly available data and perform data analysis to capture \ac{VH} dynamic changes over time and develop scenario paths for \ac{VH}. We simulate the proposed compartmental model for each \ac{VH} path to explain the impacts of public attitudes toward vaccination, the impacts of healthcare resources on patient outcomes, and the timing of vaccination rollout on the progression and severity of the epidemic. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing \ac{VH} improves health outcomes, reinforcing the importance of addressing \ac{VH} to curb the spread of infectious diseases. Our results show that adequate levels of critical healthcare resources are crucial for minimizing fatalities and also highlight the life-saving impact of timely and effective vaccination programs."

A small subset of prostate cancers are aggressive and require removal and treatment to prevent metastatic spread.

Here we use an unsupervised, self-organising map approach to analyse live-cell Raman spectroscopy data obtained from prostate cell-lines; our aim is to test the feasibility of this method to differentiate, at the single-cell-level, cancer from normal using high-dimensional datasets with minimal preprocessing. The results demonstrate not only successful separation of normal prostate and cancer cells, but also a new subclustering of the prostate cancer cell-line into two groups. Initial analysis of the spectra from each of the cancer subclusters demonstrates a differential expression of lipids, which, against the normal control, may be linked to disease-related changes in cellular signalling."

Our hardware-accelerated forward model, released in the Python package slicsim, includes stochastic variations of each SN's spectral flux distribution (based on the pre-trained BayeSN model), extinction from dust in the host and in the Milky Way, redshift, and realistic instrumental noise. By utilising truncated marginal neural ratio estimation (TMNRE), a neural network-enabled simulation-based inference technique, we implicitly marginalise over 4000 latent variables (for a set of $\approx 100$ SNae Ia) to efficiently infer SN Ia absolute magnitudes and host-galaxy dust properties at the population level while also constraining the parameters of individual objects. Amortisation of the inference procedure allows us to obtain coverage guarantees for our results through Bayesian validation and frequentist calibration. Furthermore, we show a detailed comparison to full likelihood-based inference, implemented through Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, on simulated data and then apply TMNRE to the light curves of 86 SNae Ia from the Carnegie Supernova Project, deriving marginal posteriors in excellent agreement with previous work. Given its ability to accommodate arbitrarily complex extensions to the forward model -- e.g. different populations based on host properties, redshift evolution, complicated photometric redshift estimates, selection effects, and non-Ia contamination -- without significant modifications to the inference procedure, TMNRE has the potential to become the tool of choice for cosmological parameter inference from future, large SN Ia samples."

Further, $γ$ is found to evolve smoothly from a topologically ordered state to a distribution of trivial states as a function of rate of measurement (temperature). We assess our model by contrasting it with the Toric Code limit of the Kitaev model, whose ground state has abelian $Z_2$ topological order, and which has garnered greater attention in the literature of fault-tolerant quantum computation. The findings reveal the topological order in the Toric Code limit collapses rapidly as opposed to our model where it can withstand higher measurement rates."

This work focuses on one such opportunity, termed compressor sequencing, which entails intelligently selecting the operational state of the compressors to service the required refrigeration load with the least possible work. We first study the static compressor sequencing problem and observe that deriving the optimal compressor operational state is computationally challenging and can vary dramatically based on the refrigeration load. Thus we introduce load shifting in conjunction with compressor sequencing, which entails strategically precooling the facility to allow for more efficient compressor operation. Interestingly, we show that load shifting not only provides benefits in computing the optimal compressor operational state, but also can lead to significant energy savings. Our results are based on and compared to real-world sensor data from an operating industrial refrigeration site of Butterball LLC located in Huntsville, AR, which demonstrated that without load shifting, even optimal compressor operation results in compressors often running at intermediate capacity levels, which can lead to inefficiencies. Through collected data, we demonstrate that a load shifting approach for compressor sequencing has the potential to reduce energy use of the compressors up to 20% compared to optimal sequencing without load shifting."

However, this technology increases the frequency of handover (HO) procedures caused by the dense deployment of cells in the network with reduced cell coverage, bringing new security and privacy issues. The current 5G-AKA and HO protocols are vulnerable to security weaknesses, such as the lack of forward secrecy and identity confusion attacks. The high HO frequency of HOs might magnify these security and privacy concerns in the 5G mobile network. This work addresses these issues by proposing a secure privacy-preserving universal HO scheme ($\UniHand$) for SCNs in 5G mobile communication. $\UniHand$ can achieve mutual authentication, strong anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, key-escrow-free and key compromise impersonation (KCI) resilience. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \textit{first} scheme to achieve secure, privacy-preserving universal HO with \textit{KCI} resilience for roaming users in 5G environment.

Ineffective scheduling can lead to waste, delays, and low vaccine coverage, potentially weakening the efforts to protect the public. Organizations such as UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund), PAHO (Pan American Health Organization), and GAVI (Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance) coordinate vaccine tenders to ensure that enough supply is available on the international market at the lowest possible prices. Scheduling vaccine tenders over a planning horizon in a way that is equitable, efficient, and accessible is a complex problem that involves trade-offs between multiple objectives while ensuring that vaccine availability, demand, and logistical constraints are met. The current method for scheduling tenders is generally reactive and over short planning horizons. Vaccine tenders are scheduled when supply is insufficient to cover demand. We propose an optimization model to dynamically and proactively generate vaccine tender schedules over long planning horizons. This model helps us address the following research questions: What should the optimal sequencing and scheduling of vaccine tenders be to enhance affordability and profit over long time horizons? What is the optimal tender procurement schedule for single or multiple antigen scenarios? We use several real-life data sources to validate the model and address our research questions.

We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $β_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories."

As a result, even though these planets are quite rare, they represent amajor fraction of the current exoplanet population. A side-effect of theproximity between the planet and the star is that the two have strong mutualinteractions through a number of physical processes. One of the most importantof these processes is tides. Tides are thought to shape the orbits of close-inexoplanets, heat the planet making its radius expand, and even drive someplanets to spiral into their host stars. This chapter briefly introduces thebasics of tidal physics and describes the various fingerprints tides leavewithin the observed exoplanet population."

Mushtukov']","The accretion flow within the magnetospheric radius of bright X-ray pulsars can form an optically thick envelope, concealing the central neutron star from the distant observer. Most photons are emitted at the surface of a neutron star and leave the system after multiple reflections by the accretion material covering the magnetosphere. Reflections cause momentum to be transferred between photons and the accretion flow, which contributes to the radiative force and should thus influence the dynamics of accretion. We employ Monte Carlo simulations and estimate the acceleration along magnetic field lines due to the radiative force as well as the radiation pressure across magnetic field lines. We demonstrate that the radiative acceleration can exceed gravitational acceleration along the field lines, and similarly, radiation pressure can exceed magnetic field pressure. Multiple reflections of X-ray photons back into the envelope tend to amplify both radiative force along the field lines and radiative pressure. We analyze the average photon escape time from the magnetosphere of a star and show that its absolute value is weakly dependent on the magnetic field strength of a star and roughly linearly dependent on the mass accretion rate being $\sim 0.1\,{\rm s}$ at $\dot{M}\sim 10^{20}\,{\rm g\,s^{-1}}$. At high mass accretion rates, the escape time can be longer than free-fall time from the inner disc radius."

However, several studies have revealed that these models are not effective for everyone due to the imbalanced geographical and economic representation of the data used in the training process. Most of this data comes from Western countries, leading to poor results for underrepresented countries. To address this issue, more data needs to be collected from these countries, but the cost of annotation can be a significant bottleneck. In this paper, we propose methods to identify the data to be annotated to balance model performance and annotation costs. Our approach first involves finding the countries with images of topics (objects and actions) most visually distinct from those already in the training datasets used by current large vision-language foundation models. Next, we identify countries with higher visual similarity for these topics and show that using data from these countries to supplement the training data improves model performance and reduces annotation costs. The resulting lists of countries and corresponding topics are made available at https://github.com/MichiganNLP/visual_diversity_budget."

Wieners', 'Anna S. von der Heydt']","Climate policy has become increasingly politicized in many countries including the US, with some political parties unwilling to pursue strong measures. Therefore, to be successful in mitigation, climate policies must be politically feasible. Currently, climate mitigation pathways are explored in so-called Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) which evaluate climate policies from an economic perspective, typically focusing on cost-effectiveness and overlooking transition costs. However, the economy is intertwined with the political system, in which policymakers impose economic policies, but are (in democracies) dependent on public opinion, which in turn can be influenced by economic performance. In cases where some parties are much less ambitious in climate mitigation than others, climate policy can be abruptly disrupted, influencing voting behaviour. In this study, we analyze the political feasibility of a set of green policies in case some parties are strongly unwilling to protect the climate. We show that this simple additional social layer of complexity largely affects the outcome of the abatement measures. In particular, we conclude that a (high) pure carbon tax is particularly vulnerable to abrupt interruptions and its economic side effects discourage votes for green parties. Nevertheless, a strategically selected combination of policies can reduce political uncertainty, resulting in a more feasible and effective mitigation measure."

In the robotics field, the UI design is an intriguing area to be explored due to the creation of devices with a wide range of functionalities in a reduced size. Moreover, the idea of using the same UI to control several systems arouses a great interest considering that this involves less learning effort and time for the users. Therefore, this paper will present a mobile application to control two industrial robots with four modes of operation. Design/methodology/approach: The smartphone was selected to be the interface due to its wide range of capabilities and the MIT Inventor App was used to create the application, whose environment is supported by Android smartphones. For the validation, ROS was used since it is a fundamental framework utilised in industrial robotics and the Arduino Uno was used to establish the data transmission between the smartphone and the board NVIDIA Jetson TX2. In MIT Inventor App, the graphical interface was created to visualize the options available in the app whereas two scripts in python were programmed to perform the simulations in ROS and carry out the tests. Findings: The results indicated that the use of the sliders to control the robots is more favourable than the Orientation Sensor due to the sensibility of the sensor and human limitations to hold the smartphone perfectly still. Another important finding was the limitations of the autonomous mode, in which the robot grabs an object. In this case, the configuration of the Kinect camera and the controllers has a significant impact on the success of the simulation. Finally, it was observed that the delay was appropriate despite the use of the Arduino UNO to transfer the data between the Smartphone and the Nvidia Jetson TX2."

These models are often inaccurate and based on offline information, so that the robot planner is unable to cope with mismatches between the expected and the actual behavior of the system (e.g., the presence of an unexpected obstacle). In these situations, the robot should use information gathered online to correct its planning strategy and adapt to the actual system response. We propose a sampling-based motion planning approach that uses an estimate of the model error and online observations to correct the planning strategy at each new replanning. Our approach adapts the cost function and the sampling bias of a kinodynamic motion planner when the outcome of the executed transitions is different from the expected one (e.g., when the robot unexpectedly collides with an obstacle) so that future trajectories will avoid unreliable motions. To infer the properties of a new transition, we introduce the notion of context-awareness, i.e., we store local environment information for each executed transition and avoid new transitions with context similar to previous unreliable ones. This is helpful for leveraging online information even if the simulated transitions are far (in the state-and-action space) from the executed ones. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed approach increases the success rate in execution and reduces the number of replannings needed to reach the goal."

Watt', 'Victor S. Batista']","Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major health concern which can lead to serious adverse effects including life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias via the blockade of the voltage-gated hERG potassium ion channel. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods to identify hERG-active compounds in early stages of drug development, as well as to optimize commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and marketed drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. These models can also serve independently as effective components of a virtual screening pipeline. We applied the complete framework to pimozide, an FDA-approved antipsychotic agent that demonstrates high affinity to the hERG channel, and generated 100 refined candidates. Remarkably, among the candidates is fluspirilene, a compound which is of the same class of drugs (diphenylmethanes) as pimozide and therefore has similar pharmacological activity, yet exhibits over 700-fold weaker binding to hERG. We have made all of our software open-source to facilitate integration of the CardioGenAI framework for molecular hypothesis generation into drug discovery workflows."

We will establish (paying particular attention to large, or small, ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansions terms as linear combinations, with rational polynomial coefficients, of higher order derivatives of the limit law $F_β$. With a proper parametrization, the expansions in the Gaussian cases can be understood, for given $n$, as the limit $p\to\infty$ of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $β=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $β=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focussing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with a sample size of a thousand million."

A phenomenon of such regulation is contact inhibition, which describes the dramatic slowing of proliferation, cell migration and individual cell growth when multiple cells are in contact with each other. While many physiological, molecular and genetic factors are known, the mechanism of contact inhibition is still not fully understood. In particular, the relevance of cellular signaling due to interfacial contact for contact inhibition is still debated. Cellular automata (CA) have been employed in the past as numerically efficient mathematical models to study the dynamics of cell ensembles, but they are not suitable to explore the origins of contact inhibition as such agent-based models assume fixed cell sizes. We develop a minimal, data-driven model to simulate the dynamics of planar cell cultures by extending a probabilistic CA to incorporate size changes of individual cells during growth and cell division. We successfully apply this model to previous in-vitro experiments on contact inhibition in epithelial tissue: After a systematic calibration of the model parameters to measurements of single-cell dynamics, our CA model quantitatively reproduces independent measurements of emergent, culture-wide features, like colony size, cell density and collective cell migration. In particular, the dynamics of the CA model also exhibit the transition from a low-density confluent regime to a stationary postconfluent regime with a rapid decrease in cell size and motion. This implies that the volume exclusion principle, a mechanical constraint which is the only inter-cellular interaction incorporated in the model, paired with a size-dependent proliferation rate is sufficient to generate the observed contact inhibition."

However, current methodologies often treat these two tasks as separate entities, thereby failing to leverage shared knowledge. Moreover, the complexity and diversity of remote sensing image scenes pose additional challenges, as most algorithms are designed to model individual small datasets, thus lacking cross-scene generalization. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive remote sensing image building understanding model, termed RSBuilding, developed from the perspective of the foundation model. RSBuilding is designed to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality. Specifically, we extract image features based on the prior knowledge of the foundation model and devise a multi-level feature sampler to augment scale information. To unify task representation and integrate image spatiotemporal clues, we introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts. Addressing the current shortage of datasets that incorporate annotations for both tasks, we have developed a federated training strategy to facilitate smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, thereby bolstering the complementarity of different tasks. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising up to 245,000 images and validated on multiple building extraction and change detection datasets. The experimental results substantiate that RSBuilding can concurrently handle two structurally distinct tasks and exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities."

Several MARL-MAPF methods choose to use communication to enrich the information one agent can perceive. However, existing works still struggle in structured environments with high obstacle density and a high number of agents. To further improve the performance of the communication-based MARL-MAPF solvers, we propose a new method, Ensembling Prioritized Hybrid Policies (EPH). We first propose a selective communication block to gather richer information for better agent coordination within multi-agent environments and train the model with a Q-learning-based algorithm. We further introduce three advanced inference strategies aimed at bolstering performance during the execution phase. First, we hybridize the neural policy with single-agent expert guidance for navigating conflict-free zones. Secondly, we propose Q value-based methods for prioritized resolution of conflicts as well as deadlock situations. Finally, we introduce a robust ensemble method that can efficiently collect the best out of multiple possible solutions. We empirically evaluate EPH in complex multi-agent environments and demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art neural methods for MAPF."

We highlight how Koo's interaction network has been shaped by multiple country-specific migrations and displays strong divides between linguistic and cultural communities, for instance, with English-speaking communities from India and Nigeria largely isolated from one another. Finally, we analyse the content shared by each linguistic community and identify cultural patterns that promote similar discourses across language groups.

In this work, we study the contributions of $ρ(770,1450)^+$, $a_2(1320)^+$ and $a_0(980,1450)^+$ resonances to these decay processes. The intermediate states $ρ(770,1450)^+$ are found to dominate the low-mass distribution of kaon pairs roughly contributing to half of the total branching fraction in each of the four decay channels. The contribution of the tensor $a_2(1320)^+$ meson is found to be negligible. Near the threshold of the kaon pair, the state $a_0(980)^+$ turns out to be much less important than expected, not being able to account for the enhancement of events in that energy region observed in the $B^+\to\bar{D}^{(*)0} K^+\bar{K}^0$ decays. Further studies both from the theoretical and experimental sides are needed to elucidate the role of the non-resonant contributions governing the formation of $K^+\bar{K}^0$ pairs near their threshold in these decay processes."

While extensively studied for classification, few XAI solutions have addressed the challenges specific to regression models. In regression, explanations need to be precisely formulated to address specific user queries (e.g.\ distinguishing between `Why is the output above 0?' and `Why is the output above 50?'). They should furthermore reflect the model's behavior on the relevant data sub-manifold. In this paper, we introduce XpertAI, a framework that disentangles the prediction strategy into multiple range-specific sub-strategies and allows the formulation of precise queries about the model (the `explanandum') as a linear combination of those sub-strategies. XpertAI is formulated generally to work alongside popular XAI attribution techniques, based on occlusion, gradient integration, or reverse propagation.

The model uses a multilayer network to identify the mechanism of drug action and disease comorbidity propagation pathways. The model is tested on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data of 7859 AF patients from 43 hospitals in Hong Kong. The model outperforms all baselines across all metrics and provides valuable molecular-level insights for clinical use.

It plays a key role in statistics and optimization: many learning problems (notably from optimal transport, generative modeling, and algorithmic fairness) include constraints or penalties framed as push-forward conditions on the model. However, the literature lacks general theoretical insights on the (non)convexity of such constraints and its consequences on the associated learning problems. This paper aims at filling this gap. In a first part, we provide a range of sufficient and necessary conditions for the (non)convexity of two sets of functions: the maps transporting one probability measure to another; the maps inducing equal output distributions across distinct probability measures. This highlights that for most probability measures, these push-forward constraints are not convex. In a second time, we show how this result implies critical limitations on the design of convex optimization problems for learning generative models or group-fair predictors. This work will hopefully help researchers and practitioners have a better understanding of the critical impact of push-forward conditions onto convexity."

Although this client selection strategy aims to reduce communication overhead, it remains energy and computationally inefficient, especially when considering resource-constrained devices as clients. This is because conventional random client selection overlooks the content of exchanged information and falls short of providing a mechanism to reduce the transmission of semantically redundant data. To overcome this challenge, we propose clustering the clients with the aid of similarity metrics, where a single client from each of the formed clusters is selected in each round to participate in the federated training. To evaluate our approach, we perform an extensive feasibility study considering the use of nine statistical metrics in the clustering process. Simulation results reveal that, when considering a scenario with high data heterogeneity of clients, similarity-based clustering can reduce the number of required rounds compared to the baseline random client selection. In addition, energy consumption can be notably reduced from 23.93% to 41.61%, for those similarity metrics with an equivalent number of clients per round as the baseline random scheme."

It is known that the homogeneous charged pion condensate takes up the ground state in the presence of the isospin chemical potential, and therein arises the Abrikosov vortex lattice with an applied magnetic field. We first demonstrate that a vortex sustaining the same quantized magnetic flux as the conventional Abrikosov vortex, carries a baryon number captured by the third homotopy group of Skyrmions, given the added modulation of the neutral pion inside the vortex core. Such a state is therefore dubbed the baryonic vortex. We reveal that when the baryon chemical potential is above a critical value, the baryonic vortex has negative tension measured from the charged pion condensation. It implies the baryonic vortex phase would emerge spontaneously without any external magnetic field, and take over the ground state at high density. This new phase contributes to the comprehension of QCD phase diagram and could be relevant to the generation of magnetic fields inside neutron stars."

In this article, we focus on knowledge transfer for unsupervised learning tasks in contrast to the supervised learning tasks in the literature. Given the transferable source populations, we propose a two-step transfer learning algorithm to extract useful information from multiple source principal component analysis (PCA) studies, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy for the target PCA task. In the first step, we integrate the shared subspace information across multiple studies by a proposed method named as Grassmannian barycenter, instead of directly performing PCA on the pooled dataset. The proposed Grassmannian barycenter method enjoys robustness and computational advantages in more general cases. Then the resulting estimator for the shared subspace from the first step is further utilized to estimate the target private subspace in the second step. Our theoretical analysis credits the gain of knowledge transfer between PCA studies to the enlarged eigenvalue gap, which is different from the existing supervised transfer learning tasks where sparsity plays the central role. In addition, we prove that the bilinear forms of the empirical spectral projectors have asymptotic normality under weaker eigenvalue gap conditions after knowledge transfer. When the set of informativesources is unknown, we endow our algorithm with the capability of useful dataset selection by solving a rectified optimization problem on the Grassmann manifold, which in turn leads to a computationally friendly rectified Grassmannian K-means procedure. In the end, extensive numerical simulation results and a real data case concerning activity recognition are reported to support our theoretical claims and to illustrate the empirical usefulness of the proposed transfer learning methods."

Genton', 'David E. Keyes', 'Hatem Ltaief', 'Ying Sun']","Gaussian processes (GPs) are commonly used for geospatial analysis, but they suffer from high computational complexity when dealing with massive data. For instance, the log-likelihood function required in estimating the statistical model parameters for geospatial data is a computationally intensive procedure that involves computing the inverse of a covariance matrix with size n X n, where n represents the number of geographical locations. As a result, in the literature, studies have shifted towards approximation methods to handle larger values of n effectively while maintaining high accuracy. These methods encompass a range of techniques, including low-rank and sparse approximations. Vecchia approximation is one of the most promising methods to speed up evaluating the log-likelihood function. This study presents a parallel implementation of the Vecchia approximation, utilizing batched matrix computations on contemporary GPUs. The proposed implementation relies on batched linear algebra routines to efficiently execute individual conditional distributions in the Vecchia algorithm. We rely on the KBLAS linear algebra library to perform batched linear algebra operations, reducing the time to solution compared to the state-of-the-art parallel implementation of the likelihood estimation operation in the ExaGeoStat software by up to 700X, 833X, 1380X on 32GB GV100, 80GB A100, and 80GB H100 GPUs, respectively. We also successfully manage larger problem sizes on a single NVIDIA GPU, accommodating up to 1M locations with 80GB A100 and H100 GPUs while maintaining the necessary application accuracy. We further assess the accuracy performance of the implemented algorithm, identifying the optimal settings for the Vecchia approximation algorithm to preserve accuracy on two real geospatial datasets: soil moisture data in the Mississippi Basin area and wind speed data in the Middle East."

Herein, we first established an optical detection method based on a gold chip coating with 3-mercaptophenylboronic acid (3-MPBA) to capture bacterial cells, which allows for the detection and quantification of bacterial cells with a standard light microscope under low-magnification (10 fold) objective lens. Then, integrating the developed optical detection method with swab sampling to achieve to detect bacterial cells loading on stainless-steel surfaces. Using Salmonella enterica (SE1045) and Escherichia coli as model bacterial cells, we achieved a capture efficiency of up to 76.0 % for SE1045 cells and 81.1 % for E. coli cells at Log 3 CFU/mL upon the optimized conditions. Our assay showed good linear relationship between the concentrations of bacterial cells with the cell counting in images with the limit of detection (LOD) of Log 3 CFU/mL for both SE1045 and E. coli cells. A further increase in sensitivity in detecting E. coli cells was achieved through a heat treatment, enabling the LOD to be pushed as low as Log 2 CFU/mL. Furthermore, successful application was observed in assessing bacterial contamination on stainless-steel surface following integrating with swab collection, achieving a recovery rate of approximately 70 % suggests future prospects for evaluating the cleanliness of surfaces. The entire process was completed within around 2 hours, with a cost of merely 2 dollars per sample. Given a standard light microscope cost around 250 dollars, our developed method has shown great potential in practical industrial applications for bacterial contamination control on surfaces in low-resource settings."

Nonetheless, in some specific domains, there are still concerns regarding cost and trade-offs between privacy issues and accuracy. In this study, we introduce a cost-effective and self-adaptive LLM shaking tuning and recovery mechanism, named CypherTalk. With carefully designed horizontal and vertical shaking operators, we can achieve comparable accuracy results with SOTA privacy-preserving LLM schemes using Cryptography-based or Differential Privacy-based methods. Experiments also show that with the CypherTalk framework, users can achieve reliable accuracy when using optimized shaking operator settings. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that considers cost, and trade-off between model utility and privacy in LLM scenarios."

The representation of strategic agents considering inter-temporal constraints within a stochastic framework brings additional complexity to the already difficult single-period bilevel, thus, non-convex, optimal bidding problem. Thus, we propose a simulation methodology that effectively addresses these challenges for large-scale hydrothermal power systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through a case study with real data from the large-scale Brazilian power system. In the case studies, we show the effects of market concentration in power systems and how contracts can be used to mitigate them. In particular, we show how market power might affect the current setting in Brazil. The developed method can strongly benefit policy makers, market monitors, and market designers as simulations can be used to understand existing power systems and experiment with alternative designs."

We aimed to study the host galaxies of sixty four of these cold quasars in order to probe how the supermassive black holes and host galaxies were coevolving. We compiled data from the XXL survey and crossmatched with the VHS, WISE, and HerMES surveys to obtain multiwavelength photometry spanning the Xray to the infrared and including optical spectroscopy. From the data, we calculated the supermassive black hole masses using broad emission from the magnesium II and hydrogen beta lines. We compared this with the stellar mass of the entire galaxy and find that the black holes are significantly more massive than would be predicted by local relations, indicating that the majority of black hole growth precedes the bulk of the the stellar mass formation. In addition to this, we created a spectral energy distribution for each galaxy to calculate the star formation rate. We compared the star formation rate with the black hole accretion rate and find that the stellar mass is rapidly increasing at a relative rate faster than the black hole growth, supporting the picture where the black hole grows first."

In systems of two pseudo-spin degrees, two particles configure symmetric states and anti-symmetric states, but the spin symmetry can be mixed for more particles. We study the role of mixed spin symmetry in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and consider the system of three bosons with two hyper-fine states trapped in a harmonic potential. We investigate the ground state and the energy spectrum by implementing exact diagonalization. It is found that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and repulsive interactions between anti-aligned pseudo-spins increases the population of the unaligned spin components in the ground state. The emergence of the mixed spin symmetric states compensates for the rise of the interaction energy. With the aligned interaction on, the avoided crossing between the ground state and the first excited state is observed only for small interaction, and this causes shape changes in the spin populations. Furthermore, we find that the pair correlation of the ground state shows similarly to that of Tonks-Girardeau gas even for relatively small contact interactions and such strong interaction feature is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling."

While theoretical understanding of this approximation to the ballistic arrivals is well established, the equivalent analysis for the non-ballistic arrivals is alarmingly inadequate compared to the exponential growth of its applications. To provide a fundamental understanding of the cross-correlation functions beyond the ballistic arrivals, we derive analytical stationary phase solutions for ambient noise cross-correlations with a focus on non-ballistic arrivals. We establish the mathematical and corresponding physical conditions that drastically differentiate the non-ballistic arrivals in the stacked cross-correlation and the actual Green's functions. In ambient noise environments, the coda waves due to random medium scatterings of an impulsive source cannot be distinguished from the cross-talk artifacts due to overlapping random noise sources. Therefore, changes in the non-ballistic arrivals cannot be uniquely attributed to changes in the medium or changes in the noise source environment without additional constraints. The theoretical results demand that interpreting large-elapse-time arrivals in the stacked cross-correlation functions as coda waves for deterministic information about the propagation medium should be conducted only after the source influence is sufficiently ruled out. Once the source influence is eliminated, the stationary phase solutions for scattering waves provide a solid basis for extracting reliable scattering information from the noise correlation functions for higher-resolution imaging and monitoring."

Manual segmentation of tumors in whole-body PET images is time-consuming, labor-intensive and operator-dependent. In this work, we develop and validate a fast and efficient three-step cascaded deep learning model for automated detection and segmentation of DLBCL tumors from PET images. As compared to a single end-to-end network for segmentation of tumors in whole-body PET images, our three-step model is more effective (improves 3D Dice score from 58.9% to 78.1%) since each of its specialized modules, namely the slice classifier, the tumor detector and the tumor segmentor, can be trained independently to a high degree of skill to carry out a specific task, rather than a single network with suboptimal performance on overall segmentation."

Strampelli', 'Massimo Robberto', 'Laurent Pueyo', 'Mario Gennaro', 'Carlo F. Manara', 'Elena Sabbi', 'Antonio Aparicio']","We have performed a comprehensive study of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) combining the photometric data obtained by the two \textit{HST} Treasury programs that targeted this region. To consistently analyze the rich dataset obtained in a wide variety of filters, we adopted a Bayesian approach to fit the Spectral Energy Distribution of the sources, deriving mass, age, extinction, distance, and accretion for each source in the region. The three dimensional study of mass distribution for bona-fide cluster members shows that mass segregation in the ONC extends to sub-solar masses, while the age distribution strongly supports the idea that star formation in the ONC is best described by a major episode of star formation that happened $\sim 1$ Myr ago. For masses $\gtrsim 0.1$ \Msun, our derived empirical initial mass function (IMF) is in good agreement with a Chabrier system IMF. Both the accretion luminosity (\Lacc) and mass accretion rates (\dMacc) are best described by broken power-law relations. This suggests that for the majority of young circumstellar disks in this cluster the excess emission may be dominated by X-ray-driven photoevaporation by the central star rather than external photoevaporation. If this is the case, the slopes of the power-law relations may be largely determined by the initial conditions set at the onset of the star formation process, which may be quite similar between regions that eventually form clusters of different sizes."

In the literature, there has been an extensive focus on object labeling and exhaustive scene graph generation; less effort has been focused on the task of purely identifying and mapping large semantic regions. The present work proposes a method for semantic region mapping via embodied navigation in indoor environments, generating a high-level representation of the knowledge of the agent. To enable region identification, the method uses a vision-to-language model to provide scene information for mapping. By projecting egocentric scene understanding into the global frame, the proposed method generates a semantic map as a distribution over possible region labels at each location. This mapping procedure is paired with a trained navigation policy to enable autonomous map generation. The proposed method significantly outperforms a variety of baselines, including an object-based system and a pretrained scene classifier, in experiments in a photorealistic simulator."

We show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases."

We also calculate this effect including modifications to the absorption cross section threshold from subluminal Lorentz invariance violation (LIV). We show for the first time that subluminal LIV can lead to increases or decreases in $τ_{γγ}$ compared to the non-LIV case. We show that, at least in principle, LIV can be probed with this effect with observations of $γ$-ray sources near the Sun at $\gtrsim20$ TeV by HAWC or LHAASO, although a measurement will be extremely difficult due to the small size of the effect."

First, the surface morphology and elemental analysis of the pristine material were examined by atomic force and scanning electron microscopies, and by energy-dispersive and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies, respectively. The Hastalex surface was then modified by plasma, 3 and 8 W with exposure times up to 240 s, the impact of which on the material surface wettability and morphology was further evaluated. In addition, the material aging was studied at room and elevated temperatures. Significant changes in surface roughness, morphology, and area were detected at the nanometre scale after plasma exposure. An increase in oxygen content due to the plasma exposure was observed both for 3 and 8 W. The plasma treatment had an outstanding effect on the cytocompatibility of Hastalex foil treated at both input powers of 3 and 8 W. The cell number of human MRC 5 fibroblasts on Hastalex foils exposed to plasma increased significantly compared to pristine Hastalex and even to tissue culture polystyrene.

Nevertheless, common methods including the global search space, scalable search space and hierarchical search space have certain limitations. Specifically, the global search space requires a significant amount of computational resources and time, the scalable search space sacrifices the diversity of network structures and the hierarchical search space increases the search cost in exchange for network diversity. To address above limitation, we propose a novel paradigm of searching neural network architectures and design the Multiple Population Alternate Evolution Neural Architecture Search (MPAE), which can achieve module diversity with a smaller search cost. MPAE converts the search space into L interconnected units and sequentially searches the units, then the above search of the entire network be cycled several times to reduce the impact of previous units on subsequent units. To accelerate the population evolution process, we also propose the the population migration mechanism establishes an excellent migration archive and transfers the excellent knowledge and experience in the migration archive to new populations.

There are almost 200 countries affected across the globe by COVID-19 and it has ruined many lives and the global economy. The virus is spreading very rapidly at the pace of around 10 fold in less than a month. Also, in the case of COVID- 19 it is critical to detect the infection as it employs various symptoms which may differ from person to person. Hence, diagnosis in starting stage and treatment are very much important for such type of infectious disease. The chest x-ray is one of the primary techniques among blood tests and Computed Tomography contributes a major role in the early diagnosis of COVID-19. There is a rising need for automated and auxiliary diagnostic tools for early diagnosis, as there are no accurate and truthful automated tool kits on hand. In this research study, we have designed a Convolution Neural Network architecture a deep net for the classification of x-ray images of chest among two classes: COVID-19 or Non-COVID- 19 infection.

The first player aims is to minimize, and the second player to maximize, the regret: The minimal prediction loss using the representation, compared to the same loss using the original features. For the canonical setting in which the representation, the response to predict and the predictors are all linear functions, and under the mean squared error loss function, we derive the theoretically optimal representation in pure strategies, which shows the effectiveness of the prior knowledge, and the optimal regret in mixed strategies, which shows the usefulness of randomizing the representation. For general representations and loss functions, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize a randomized representation. The algorithm only requires the gradients of the loss function, and is based on incrementally adding a representation rule to a mixture of such rules."

Most of the analysis in the literature has been performed on fully-discrete methods using first order methods in time, typically the implicit Euler time integrator. Our aim is to show which kind of error bounds can be obtained using any time integrator, both in the full order model (FOM), applied to compute the snapshots, and in the POD-ROM method. To this end, we analyze in this paper the continuous-in-time case for both the FOM and POD-ROM methods, although the POD basis is obtained from snapshots taken at a discrete (i.e., not continuous) set times. Two cases for the set of snapshots are considered: The case in which the snapshots are based on first order divided differences in time and the case in which they are based on temporal derivatives. Optimal pointwise-in-time error bounds {between the FOM and the POD-ROM solutions} are proved for the $L^2(Ω)$ norm of the error for a semilinear reaction-diffusion model problem. The dependency of the errors on the distance in time between two consecutive snapshots and on the tail of the POD eigenvalues is tracked. Our detailed analysis allows to show that, in some situations, a small number of snapshots in a given time interval might be sufficient to accurately approximate the solution in the full interval. Numerical studies support the error analysis."

By setting the inertial parameter according to the condition number of the objective function, these methods guarantee a fast exponential decay of the error. We prove that this type of schemes (which are later called Heavy Ball schemes) is relevant in a relaxed setting, i.e. for composite functions satisfying a quadratic growth condition. In particular, we adapt V-FISTA, introduced by Beck in [10] for strongly convex functions, to this broader class of functions. To the authors' knowledge, the resulting worst-case convergence rates are faster than any other in the literature, including those of FISTA restart schemes. No assumption on the set of minimizers is required and guarantees are also given in the non-optimal case, i.e. when the condition number is not exactly known. This analysis follows the study of the corresponding continuous-time dynamical system (Heavy Ball with friction system), for which new convergence results of the trajectory are shown."

Analyzing all available archival soft and hard X-ray observations, we investigate the line-of-sight hydrogen column density (N_H) variability on timescales ranging from a few days to approximately 20 years. Each source is analyzed by simultaneously modeling the data with three physical torus models, providing tight constraints on torus properties, including the covering factor, the cloud dispersion, and the torus average hydrogen column density (N_H,av). For each epoch, we measure the N_H and categorize the source as `N_H Variable', `Non-variable in N_H', or `Undetermined' based on the degree of variability. Our final sample includes 27 variable, Compton-thin AGN after implementing another 14 AGN analyzed in our previous work. We find that all sources require either flux or N_H variability. We classify 37% of them as `N_H Variable', 44% as `Non-variable in N_H', and 19% as `Undetermined'. Noticeably, there is no discernible difference between geometrical and intrinsic properties among the three variability classes, suggesting no intrinsic differences between the N_H-variable and non-variable sources. We measure the median variation in N_H between any observation pair of the same source to be 25% with respect to the lowest N_H measure in the pair. Furthermore, 48% of the analyzed sources require the inclusion of a Compton-thick reflector in the spectral fitting.

The cells, e.g., represent different range and bearing values. However, conventional multiobject tracking methods use so-called point measurements. Point measurements are provided by a preprocessing stage that applies a threshold or detector and breaks up the cell's structure by converting cell indexes into, e.g., range and bearing measurements. We here propose a Bayesian multiobject tracking method that processes measurements that have been thresholded but are still cell-structured. We first derive a likelihood function that systematically incorporates an adjustable detection threshold which makes it possible to control the number of cell measurements. We then propose a Poisson Multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter based on the likelihood function for cell measurements. Furthermore, we establish a link to the conventional point measurement model by deriving the likelihood function for point measurements with amplitude information (AM) and discuss the PMB filter that uses point measurements with AM. Our numerical results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method that relies on thresholded cell measurements compared to the conventional multiobject tracking based on point measurements with and without AM."

We prove a general criterion for the appearance of 4-torsion classes based on (twisted) Steenrod squares and show that there are many cases where this criterion is satisfied for minimal-degree anomalous classes, assuming a conjecture on the characteristic rank. We also establish the upper bound in the characteristic rank conjecture for oriented Grassmannians $\tilde{Gr}_k(n)$, and prove the equality in the cases $k=5, n=2^t-1,2^t$ and $k=6, n=2^t$. This provides infinitely many examples of oriented Grassmannians having 4-torsion in their integral cohomology. On the way, we clarify the relation between minimal-degree anomalous classes and results of Stong on the height of the first Stiefel-Whitney class $w_1$ in the mod 2 cohomology of real Grassmannians, for which we give an independent proof. We also establish some bounds on torsion exponents for the integral cohomology of oriented flag manifolds. Based on these findings and further computational evidence, we formulate a conjectural relationship between the torsion exponent in the integral cohomology of homogeneous spaces and their deficiency."

Of particular note is the efficacy of the toddler-inspired Sparse-to-Dense (S2D) transition.

We estimate the total intrinsic scatter in the magnitude of the RTF relation(s) implementing a cosmological model-independent cosmographic expansion. We find that the maximum allowed local variation in our baseline analysis, using 4 RTF relations in the galaxy sample is $ΔH_0/H_0 \lesssim 3 \%$ at a $95\%$ C.L. significance. Which is implied form a constraint of $ΔH_0/H_0 = 0.54^{+1.32}_{-1.37} \%$ estimated at $D_{\rm{L}}\sim 10\, [\rm{Mpc}]$. Using only one `best-constrained' radial bin we report a conservative $95\%$ C.L. limit of $ΔH_0/H_0 \lesssim 4 \%$. Through our estimate of maximum variation, we propose a novel method to validate several late-time/local modifications put forth to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We find that within the range of the current galaxy sample redshift distribution $10 \, [\rm{Mpc}] \le D_{\rm{L}} \le 140\, [\rm{Mpc}]$, it is highly unlikely to obtain a variation of $ΔH_0/H_0 \sim 9\%$, necessary to alleviate the $H_0$-tension. However, we also elaborate on the possible alternative inferences when the innermost radial bin is included in the analysis. Alongside the primary analysis of fitting the individual RTF relations independently, we propose and perform a joint analysis of the RTF relations useful to create a pseudo-standardizable sample of galaxies. We also test for the spatial variation of $H_0$, finding that the current samples' galaxies distributed only in the southern hemisphere support the null hypothesis of isotropy, within the allowed noise levels."

In the setting of low frequency observations and infinite time horizon we also study the convergence of three local time estimators, that are already known to converge to the local time in the setting of high frequency observations and fixed time horizon.

This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry."

However, current medical image synthesis methods often struggle to accurately capture the complexity of detailed anatomical structures and pathological conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel medical image synthesis model that leverages fine-grained image-text alignment and anatomy-pathology prompts to generate highly detailed and accurate synthetic medical images. Our method integrates advanced natural language processing techniques with image generative modeling, enabling precise alignment between descriptive text prompts and the synthesized images' anatomical and pathological details. The proposed approach consists of two key components: an anatomy-pathology prompting module and a fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module. The anatomy-pathology prompting module automatically generates descriptive prompts for high-quality medical images. To further synthesize high-quality medical images from the generated prompts, the fine-grained alignment-based synthesis module pre-defines a visual codebook for the radiology dataset and performs fine-grained alignment between the codebook and generated prompts to obtain key patches as visual clues, facilitating accurate image synthesis. We validate the superiority of our method through experiments on public chest X-ray datasets and demonstrate that our synthetic images preserve accurate semantic information, making them valuable for various medical applications."

Towards Effective Non-collaborative Dialogues via Tailored Strategy Planning,"['Tong Zhang', 'Chen Huang', 'Yang Deng', 'Hongru Liang', 'Jia Liu', 'Zujie Wen', 'Wenqiang Lei', 'Tat-Seng Chua']","We investigate non-collaborative dialogue agents that must engage in tailored strategic planning for diverse users to secure a favorable agreement. This poses challenges for existing dialogue agents due to two main reasons: their inability to integrate user-specific characteristics into their strategic planning and their training paradigm's failure to produce strategic planners that can generalize to diverse users. To address these challenges, we propose TRIP to enhance the capability in tailored strategic planning, incorporating a user-aware strategic planning module and a population-based training paradigm. Through experiments on benchmark non-collaborative dialogue tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TRIP in catering to diverse users."

This new wave of molecular data has highlighted the expected diversity of single-cell dynamics upon shared external queues and spatial organizations. However, little is known about the relationship between single cell heterogeneity and the emergence and maintenance of robust multicellular processes in developed tissues and its role in (patho)physiology. Here, we present emerging computational modeling strategies that use increasingly available large-scale cross-condition single cell and spatial datasets, to study multicellular organization in tissues and complement cell taxonomies. This perspective should enable us to better understand how cells within tissues collectively process information and adapt synchronized responses in disease contexts and to bridge the gap between structural changes and functions in tissues."

For each such surface we introduce a geometrically determined pseudo-orthonormal frame field and writing the derivative formulas with respect to this moving frame field and using the integrability conditions, we obtain a system of six functions satisfying some natural conditions. In the general case, we prove a Fundamental Bonnet-type theorem (existence and uniqueness theorem) stating that these six functions, satisfying the natural conditions, determine the surface up to a motion. In some particular cases, we reduce the number of functions and give the fundamental theorems."

The first string models and associated theoretical framework were formulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the context of the S-matrix program for the strong interactions. In the mid-1970s, the models were reinterpreted as a potential theory unifying the four fundamental forces. This paper provides a historical analysis of how string theory was developed out of S-matrix physics, aiming to clarify how modern string theory, as a theory detached from experimental data, grew out of an S-matrix program that was strongly dependent upon observable quantities. Surprisingly, the theoretical practice of physicists already turned away from experiment before string theory was recast as a potential unified quantum gravity theory. With the formulation of dual resonance models (the ""hadronic string theory""), physicists were able to determine almost all of the models' parameters on the basis of theoretical reasoning. It was this commitment to ""non-arbitrariness"", i.e., a lack of free parameters in the theory, that initially drove string theorists away from experimental input, and not the practical inaccessibility of experimental data in the context of quantum gravity physics. This is an important observation when assessing the role of experimental data in string theory."

We find that QE encourages households with larger initial bond positions to rebalance more toward second homes. Rebalancing is especially pronounced among higher-income and church-affiliated households with stronger tax incentives to purchase and rent out properties. We also show that, in regions more exposed to this channel, house prices increase more than rents, and sale listings decrease more than rental ones, suggesting that the rental supply may increase in response to QE."

Research aimed at reducing the spread of misinformation has so far focused on user-level interventions with little emphasis on how the supply of misinformation can itself be countered. In this work, we show how online misinformation is largely financially sustained via advertising, examine how financing misinformation affects the advertisers and ad platforms involved and outline ways of reducing the financing of misinformation. First, we find that advertising on misinformation outlets is pervasive for companies across several industries and is amplified by digital ad platforms that automatically distribute companies’ ads across the web. Using an information provision survey experiment, we show that people decrease their demand for a company’s products or services upon learning about its role in monetizing misinformation via online ads. To shed light on why misinformation continues to be monetized despite the potential backlash for the advertisers involved, we survey decision-makers at companies. We find that most decision-makers are unaware of their companies’ ads appearing on misinformation websites but have a strong preference to avoid appearing on such websites. Moreover, those uncertain and unaware about their role in financing misinformation increase their demand for a platform-based solution to reduce monetizing misinformation upon learning about how platforms amplify ad placement on misinformation websites. We identify low-cost, scalable information-based interventions that digital platforms could implement to reduce the financial incentive to misinform and counter the supply of misinformation online."

We develop a life-cycle model where individuals face survival and health risk, including the possibility of becoming highly disabled and needing LTC. Households are heterogeneous in various important dimensions including education, productivity, and the age difference between spouses. Health evolves stochastically. Agents make consumption-savings decisions in a framework featuring an LTC state-dependent utility function. We find that household expenditures increase significantly when LTC becomes necessary, but married individuals are well insured against LTC risk due to IC. However, they still hold considerable assets due to the concern for the spouse who might become a widow/widower and can expect much higher LTC costs. IC significantly reduces precautionary savings for middle and high income groups, but interestingly, it encourages asset accumulation among low income groups because it reduces the probability of means-tested Medicaid LTC."

Callahan, Mathew Kiang, Joshua S. Graff Zivin, Marshall Burke","Increased temperature-related mortality is predicted to be one of the largest contributors to future economic damages from climate change globally, with declines in cold-related deaths in some regions outweighed by increases in heat-related deaths in others. Changes in temperature could also affect non-fatal health outcomes, whose aggregate societal burden is large, yet much less is known about how temperature affects the overall level and distribution of morbidity. Using georeferenced data on emergency department visits, mortality, and daily temperatures across California from 2006-2017, we show that the effect of temperature on mortality differs substantially from its effect on ED visits: mortality increases under extreme heat and cold, whereas ED visits increase under extreme heat but decline under extreme cold. These differential responses fundamentally shape the burden of future climate change: we predict that mortality in California will decrease by 0.32% due to changes in temperatures by mid-century, with declining cold deaths outweighing increasing heat deaths, but that ED visits will increase by 0.46% over the same period in the state, representing a total of 1.9 million excess visits. Our findings suggest that projected impacts of future warming on mortality, including benefits in many areas, might be a poor guide for morbidity impacts."

Hickok, Tobias Salz","We characterize optimal urban transportation policies in the presence of congestion and environmental externalities and evaluate their welfare and distributional effects. We present a framework of a municipal government that implements different transportation equilibria through its choice of public transit policies—prices and frequencies—as well as road pricing. The government faces a budget constraint that introduces monopoly-like distortions. We apply this framework to Chicago, for which we construct a new dataset that comprehensively captures transportation choices. We find that road pricing alone leads to large welfare gains by reducing externalities, but at the expense of consumers (travelers), whose surplus falls even if road pricing revenues are fully rebated. The largest losses are borne by middle income consumers, who are most reliant on cars. We find that the optimal price of public transit is close to zero and goes along with a reduction in the frequency of buses and an increase in the frequency of trains. Combining these transit policies with road pricing eliminates budget constraints. This allows the government to implement higher transit frequencies and even lower prices, in which case consumer surplus increases after rebates."
10.3386/w32151,2024-02-19 00:00:00,The Essential Role of Altruism in Medical Decision Making,"Paul Gertler, Ada Kwan","Patients rely on medical care providers to act in their best interests because providers understand disease pathology and appropriate treatment much better than patients. Providers, however, not only give advice (diagnose) but also deliver (sell) treatments based on that advice. This creates a moral hazard dilemma where provider financial interests can diverge from patient interests, especially when providers are motivated more by profits than by altruism. We investigate how profit motivated versus altruistic preferences influence medical care decision making in the context of malaria in Kenya. We measured the appropriateness of care using data from an audit study that employed standardized patients (SP) who were trained to present as real patients the identical clinical case scenario to providers. The SPs were confirmed to be malaria negative before and after field work with a very reliable and sensitive blood test at a high-quality laboratory. We measured provider preferences using a lab in the field, real stakes, modified version of the dictator game. We find that more profit-motivated providers report higher rates of false-positive malaria test results than do more altruistic providers. Specifically, purely profit motivated providers report 30 percentage points more positives than providers who are altruistically motivated, and providers likely knew that the positive results that they reported to their patients were false. We also find that more profit motivated providers sold more unnecessary antimalarial drugs than did more altruistic providers. Based on mediation analysis, more profit-oriented providers sold more drugs not only because they knowingly reported more false positives, but also because they promoted drugs sales more conditional on a positive test result. Thus, profit motivated providers seem to have misrepresented test results to sell more unnecessary malaria-related drugs."

Combining the historical data with modern administrative sources, we present a public, consolidated data series measuring U.S. government-funded patents—including funding agencies—through 2020, and we provide code to extend this series in the future. We use the data to document long-run patterns in U.S. government-funded patents and federal patent policy, propose ways in which these data can be used in future research, and discuss limitations of the data."

Study Design. We analyzed 1,787 discharges with a focus on program completion, unilateral termination by the client/family, and lost contact with the client/family.  We performed exploratory analyses of demographic, clinical, and functional predictors of discharge reason. Variables predictive of discharge type were included in multilevel logistic regressions, allowing for estimation of predictors of discharge reason and variability in rates by program and hub.  Study Results. An estimated 20-30% of enrolled patients completed the program. Program completion rates were higher among participants who were older on admission, had lower negative symptoms severity, spent more time in education, employment or training, and were covered by private insurance (a close proxy for socioeconomic status). Programs were more likely to lose contact with male participants, black participants, and participants who were never covered by private insurance. After accounting for patient-level factors, there was substantial program-level variation on all three discharge outcomes, and hub-level variability on the proportion of participants who completed the program. The impact of race on program completion varied substantially by program.  Conclusions.

Methods: A population-based prospective cohort study of Syrian refugee families living in ITS in Lebanon (BIOPATH study) was analysed. Families with children aged 8-16 years that had left Syria less than 4 years prior to recruitment were included. The first wave was conducted between October 2017 and January 2018. Follow-up data collection was conducted one year later (51.55 +/- 1.84 weeks).

Of the 2282 families approached in 77 selected settlements, 1600 (70.1%) agreed to participate. After one year, 1438 families were approached and data collected from 1009 families (62.8% re-participation rate). Data from 9 families were excluded during data cleaning. Ninety-eight variables across multiple domains (demographic, psychological, familial and community level) were measured using validated questionnaires and considered for a systematic causal discovery and inference method. Increased risk for severe and persistent PTSD based on symptom score was the primary outcome of interest. This outcome was validated a posteriori through structured clinical interviews in a subsample.  Results: 1591 child-caregiver dyads were included (age = 11.44 +/- 2.44 years, 52.6% female) and 16.2% of children were at classified as at risk for severe and persistent PTSD (DSM-5 confirmed diagnoses in clinical interviews 6 months later 62.5% vs 34.5% in children with lower risk, p&lt;.05; clinical severity score 4.5 vs 3.4, p&lt;.01).

Results: 1591 child-caregiver dyads were included (age = 11.44 +/- 2.44 years, 52.6% female) and 16.2% of children were at classified as at risk for severe and persistent PTSD (DSM-5 confirmed diagnoses in clinical interviews 6 months later 62.5% vs 34.5% in children with lower risk, p&lt;.05; clinical severity score 4.5 vs 3.4, p&lt;.01). In the systematic causal discovery and inference analysis, the level of war exposure (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03-1.11 , p&lt;.01), peer violence victimisation (OR: 1.05 , 95% CI: 1.02-1.08, p&lt;.05), neglect (OR: 1.11 , 95% CI: 1.05-1.17 , p&lt;.01), maltreatment (OR: 1.04 , 95% CI: 1.02-1.07 , p&lt;.05) and caregiver depression (OR: 1.04 , 95% CI: 1.01-1.17 , p&lt;.05) predicted risk for persistent and severe PTSD. The quality of the concurrent refugee environment (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.38-0.77, p&lt;.01) was strongly negatively associated with severe and persistent PTSD presentations. Conclusion: Minimising violent re-victimization and exposure to daily stressors, and addressing caregiver mental health, might prevent the development of severe PTSD in refugee children."

In addressing the second aim, the synthesis revealed four key findings. First, the majority of the identified measurement tools have not been evaluated for all aspects of reliability and validity, and only seven measurement tools met the common acceptability thresholds for more than two areas of psychometric evidence. Second, only three screeners demonstrated an acceptable ability to distinguish between typically developing children and those with or at-risk of mathematical learning difficulties.

Clinical scientists have spent considerable resources designing and testing depression interventions. However, due to low access to treatment for depression (more than 50% of adolescents with depression symptoms never access treatment at all) and the heterogeneity of depression itself (a major depression diagnosis reflects &gt;1400 possible symptom combinations), none have led to meaningful declines in depression’s overall burdens for adolescents. Rates of depression appear to be increasing, potentially more rapidly in adolescents compared to older groups in the US. Status-quo approaches are unlikely to sustainably improve adolescent depression. We propose that a critical and often overlooked contributor to this shortfall is youth autonomy—a key, developmentally-aligned need for adolescents—to reduce rates of depression at the population level. During adolescence, individuals begin to separate from their parents, guardians, and caregivers (hereafter caregivers), and make decisions independently. This process is critical for healthy identity formation, self-efficacy, and mental health—including prevention and reduction of depression. Youth autonomy is among myriad multi-level factors relevant to depression trajectories. However, unlike many social and structural contributors to depression, youths’ perceived autonomy is relatively modifiable through individual-level intervention, making it a promising intervention target. The psychosocial importance of youth autonomy stands in sharp contrast to modern policies and structures which undermine youth independence and control—including within many existing depression interventions. We summarize how existing youth depression interventions and mental health systems may inadvertently undermine youth autonomy. We then suggest strategies for redesigning existing interventions and policies in ways that directly promote adolescent autonomy, and in turn, help reduce depression at scale."

Introduction: Children and adolescents with language and literacy difficulties are at elevated risk of mental health concerns compared to their peers. A body of research demonstrates the effectiveness of programs to support socioemotional wellbeing among typically developing young people. However, given the reliance on language-based skills to access ‘talking therapies’ (e.g., Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), it is likely that interventions suited to the general population may be inaccessible for young people with language and literacy difficulties. As such, this scoping review aims to map the range of evidence in relation to interventions that support socioemotional wellbeing in young people with language and literacy difficulties. The review aims to identify gaps in the literature and guide future research.    Inclusion criteria: Studies will be included if they meet the following criteria: 1) The study includes participants aged up to and including 24 years with a diagnosed (or suspected diagnosis of) neurodevelopmental disorder impacting spoken and/or written language, and 2) the study reports on an intervention that targets (either directly or indirectly) the socioemotional wellbeing of those young people. Studies focusing on young people with acquired language or literacy difficulties will be excluded. This is because the nature of communication and/or socioemotional challenges among people with acquired conditions, and their subsequent needs for intervention, are likely to differ from those of young people experiencing language and literacy disorders that are developmental in nature.

Rather than focusing on how memory represents the past, recent literature often presents memory as ultimately dealing with the future–helping the organism to anticipate events and increase its adaptive success. However, the distinct contribution of episodic (as opposed to semantic) memory to future-oriented simulations remains unclear. We claim that episodic memory yields adaptive success because of its crucial role in singular counterfactual causal reasoning, which thus far has been mostly ignored in causal reasoning literature. Our paper presents a causal inference model based on the predictive processing framework and the minimal trace account of episodic memory. According to our model, evaluating the cause of an event involves (i) generating an episodic memory related to the said potential cause, (ii) constructing a counterfactual scenario through inhibition of the relevant part of the past episode, and (iii) temporal evolution followed by alternative model evaluation. We further discuss our approach in the developmental context."

OBJECTIVE: To gain evidence from FRs relating to the impact of exposure to occupational trauma and describe the development of and planned protocol for testing an evidence-based, co-created DI called Sentinel to help manage and prevent trauma among FRs. METHODS: In phase 1, we conducted 52 interviews with FRs from fire and emergency, police, and emergency healthcare to explore the needs, views and experiences on using DI to support mental health. During phase 2, we developed the DI (Sentinel) content in consultation with current evidence, policy, theory and FRs experience. In phase 3, we plan to conduct a series of codesign workshops and development sprints to test and refine the DI (Sentinel). In phase 4, we will conduct a mixed methods non-randomized study to determine the feasibility, acceptability, usability and safety of the DI (Sentinel).

Psychologists, among other professionals, were required to suddenly work remotely via telehealth during a period of global uncertainty, illness and mortality, community anxiety and lockdowns. This drastically altered the psychology practice, with the effects on clients and professionals still not fully understood. Aim To develop and validate a COVID-19-Related Stress Scale to evaluate psychologists’ experiences relating to the pandemic.  Methods The items of the COVID-19-Related Stress Scale were constructed based on an extensive qualitative report from the British Psychological Society, which identified key themes in psychologists’ pandemic experiences. Eight items were initially developed. To determine construct validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted, as well as tests for convergent and discriminant validity.  Results The sample comprised 99 psychologists in Aotearoa, New Zealand. After corrected item-total correlation testing, five items with significant and strong factor loadings (0.60 to 0.74) and two items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.54 to 0.56) were confirmed, resulting in a scale of seven items.  Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency was α = .83, supporting a single-factor model (COVID-related stress, CVRS). A moderate relationship was found between CVRS and stress and compassion fatigue, validating its utility as a measure of stress. In contrast, no relationship was seen with resilience as a discriminant construct. Conclusion The Covid-19-related stress scale shows robust psychometric properties, which usefully assessed the impact of COVID-19 among psychologists in NZ. Although the lockdown phase of the pandemic has since ended, this measure provides valuable insights into the retrospective experiences of healthcare professionals during the pandemic. It may be adapted for unexpected scenarios requiring remote therapy, such as pandemics and natural disasters. The effect of remote work and community stress on mental health professionals requires ongoing consideration, and we propose that the CVRS is a useful tool for this research."

This has been explained in terms of dynamical systems theory where internal oscillators couple to external rhythms for more fluent processing; this coupling is more efficient the closer the external rhythms are to the preferred rates of the internal oscillators. Thus, this more efficient coupling at one’s preferred rate should be associated with lower cognitive demands and better attentional entrainment compared to faster or slower rates. We tested this by measuring participants’ pupil sizes, a proxy for noradrenergic attention, while either listening or synchronizing their finger taps to metronomes played at rates faster, slower, or at their preferred rate. We found that synchronizing (relative to listening) to the faster and slower metronomes evoked larger pupil sizes whereas there was no difference at participants’ preferred rate. In line with dynamical systems theory, these results demonstrate that synchronizing is more cognitively demanding than listening only at tempi beyond one’s preferred rate. Furthermore, pupillary phase coherence increased while synchronizing compared to listening to all three metronomes, indicating that synchronous movements resulted in more efficiently allocated attention. Beyond their theoretical implications, our findings suggest that rehabilitation for movement disorders should be tailored to patients’ preferred rates to reduce cognitive demands. Moreover, attention and developmental disorders may benefit from pupillary entrainment as a diagnostic tool in rhythmic- and movement-based interventions."

In this study, we investigated the extent to which children could learn both vocabulary and grammar from cross-situational statistics, and also tested the effect of explicit instruction over the language structure on learning under two exposure conditions, implicit and explicit instruction. We trained and tested fifty children, aged 8 to 9 years, on a complex artificial language comprised of 12 pseudo-words including nouns, verbs and case markers in a verb-final sentence order by means of a widely-used CSL paradigm (e.g., Monaghan et al., 2021; Rebuschat et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2020).

The social model of disability, enshrined in teacher education programmes in the UK espouses the ways in which school environments rather than disabled children themselves, need to adapt and change. However, the role of psychology in addressing disability-related systemic injustice is less clear. The aim of this paper is to consider the potential role of the psychology of education in working towards disability justice in schools.   Why? Many inclusive teacher-education programmes set out the ways in which environments may be created to include disabled children. Psychologists have focused on disabled children’s needs to access and participate in the classroom, but often do not consider their exclusion in social model terms, from curriculum materials, classroom displays, or material culture more generally. Favazza and colleagues (e.g. 2017) now offer a sizeable body of research showing that disability representation in school classrooms is negligible. This lack of representation is reflected among the staff in the teaching profession, where the 2016 census suggests that 0.5% of English teaching staff declared a disability (DfE, 2017) and more recent census data shows disability data were not collected (DfE, 2023a). It is this lack of representation of disabled people, and its possible psychological underpinnings, that this paper addresses.   How? This paper uses social and affirmative model lenses to (a) explore the ways in which disability may be seen as a structural inequality in contemporary UK education, and (b) suggest ways in which researchers and practitioners in the Psychology of Education may work towards disability justice. This may be achieved by considering extant research practice, and through research focusing on perceptions of and attitudes towards disability, alongside existing psychological work that focuses on disabled children’s individual needs."

This lack of representation is reflected among the staff in the teaching profession, where the 2016 census suggests that 0.5% of English teaching staff declared a disability (DfE, 2017) and more recent census data shows disability data were not collected (DfE, 2023a). It is this lack of representation of disabled people, and its possible psychological underpinnings, that this paper addresses.   How? This paper uses social and affirmative model lenses to (a) explore the ways in which disability may be seen as a structural inequality in contemporary UK education, and (b) suggest ways in which researchers and practitioners in the Psychology of Education may work towards disability justice. This may be achieved by considering extant research practice, and through research focusing on perceptions of and attitudes towards disability, alongside existing psychological work that focuses on disabled children’s individual needs."

This is, in part, due to a lack of measurement tools for characterizing lifetime exposure to loss. We propose three novel indices as the first to simultaneously measure premature and cumulative lifetime loss—two typically unmeasured dimensions of loss. Using a nationally representative longitudinal U.S. sample of 27,986 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS, 1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, we assessed racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated loss of family members over the lifespan. Hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative lifetime loss burden than White participants across all three indices. These effects consistently remained after sensitivity analyses controlling for sociodemographic variables such as parental education, household size, and birth cohort. Secondly, we provided initial construct validity evidence of our three indices by demonstrating their distinguishability from other measures of lifetime stressors and current, chronic stressors, presenting a case for attending to lifetime exposure to grief as a unique stressor. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to premature and cumulative death. The proposed novel measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health."

However, many interventions that encourage individuals to make more sustainable choices do not lead to the desired behavioral change. To tackle this challenge, we take a step back and focus on understanding the complex motivational structure behind sustainable behaviors. We (i) identify individually relevant motives for sustainable behaviors, (ii) show that these motives can be predicted from demographic variables and individuals’ economic preferences, and (iii) discuss how these insights can be used for designing more efficient behavioral interventions.  We base our analysis on rich multinational survey data collected from 1,954 respondents across the United States, China, and the Netherlands. Our approach is based on a novel large language model. We identify 14 motives in 14,262 individual responses to open-ended questions that elicit reasons for seven sustainable behaviors. For example, the motive Health Comfort is the most relevant and most general motive for the behaviors we studied, ranging from showering time to frequency of flying. Individually relevant motives are associated with demographic variables such as gender and age, but also economic preferences. For respondents with a lower discount rate, for example, the motive Electricity Energy is very important, whereas Want Feel is less relevant. Our analysis also reveals striking similarities regarding the relevance and behavioral specificity of motives across the cultures.

However, many interventions that encourage individuals to make more sustainable choices do not lead to the desired behavioral change. To tackle this challenge, we take a step back and focus on understanding the complex motivational structure behind sustainable behaviors. We (i) identify individually relevant motives for sustainable behaviors, (ii) show that these motives can be predicted from demographic variables and individuals’ economic preferences, and (iii) discuss how these insights can be used for designing more efficient behavioral interventions.  We base our analysis on rich multinational survey data collected from 1,954 respondents across the United States, China, and the Netherlands. Our approach is based on a novel large language model. We identify 14 motives in 14,262 individual responses to open-ended questions that elicit reasons for seven sustainable behaviors. For example, the motive Health Comfort is the most relevant and most general motive for the behaviors we studied, ranging from showering time to frequency of flying. Individually relevant motives are associated with demographic variables such as gender and age, but also economic preferences. For respondents with a lower discount rate, for example, the motive Electricity Energy is very important, whereas Want Feel is less relevant. Our analysis also reveals striking similarities regarding the relevance and behavioral specificity of motives across the cultures.  When comparing the relevant motives across behaviors, we uncover that behaviors with more overlapping motives are also more positively correlated. This finding offers an explanation of spillover effects caused by implicitly or explicitly appealing to behavioral motives that are relevant for multiple behaviors.

Findings from Two Longitudinal Studies of Aging,To be fetched,"Objective: Most work on rural-urban health disparities has been conducted with population-level data, which is limited in its capacity for causal inferences about individuals and lifespan health. The present study leverages individual-level longitudinal data, spanning up to 29 years, to understand how rurality-urbanicity predicts risk for all-cause mortality; whether these associations hold above and beyond socioeconomic status; and whether the association between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk varies by sex, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and partner status. Methods: The present pre-registered study uses data from two large longitudinal studies of U.S. Americans (HRS and MIDUS; total N = ~55,000), who reported on their socio-demographic characteristics, had their addresses linked to geographical indicators (i.e., rural-urban continuum codes), and have data from the National Death Index regarding vital status and survival time.  Results: Using cox proportional hazards regression models, findings showed that suburban and rural residents were at a 12% and 18% greater risk for earlier mortality compared to urban residents in HRS, but the associations between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk were non-significant in MIDUS. The longitudinal associations between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk were largely independent of socioeconomic status. Finally, there was only one statistically significant interaction effect, suggesting the strength and direction of the association between rurality-urbanicity and mortality risk was largely the same across sociodemographic subgroups.  Conclusions: There is tentative evidence suggesting that rurality-urbanicity is an important social determinant of longevity, over and above other sociodemographic factors. Future studies should explore how to promote longer and healthier lives among rural residents."

The legislation required food outlets belonging to large (&gt;250 employees) businesses in England selling food for immediate consumption to provide kcal labelling on all unpackaged food and non-alcoholic drinks. We examined whether the implementation of this policy was associated with a change in consumer behaviour in the OHFS.   Design: Observational study. Setting: OHFS outlets subject to the policy in four areas of England.  Participants: From August-December 2021 (pre-implementation) and August-December 2022 (post-implementation), researchers visited the same large OHFS outlets subject to kcal labelling legislation and conducted customer exit surveys. 6578 customers (3308 pre-implementation and 3270 post-implementation) from 330 outlets were surveyed.  Main outcome measures: The number of kcals purchased and consumed by customers, customers' knowledge of the kcal content of their purchases, and the extent to which customers noticed and used kcal labelling.  Results: At baseline, mean energy purchased (mean, M=1007 kcals, SD = 630) and consumed (M=909 kcals, SD = 548) per customer was high compared to national guidance.

At baseline, we found the more individualistic a nation, the less its residents believed in climate change, supported mitigation policy, and intended to share information, but did not plant fewer trees in an online task. Critically, while some interventions were more effective in individualistic (decreasing psychological distance), and some in collectivistic nations (emphasizing social norms), others were effective in both (writing a letter to the future generation).

During school closures, the home literacy environment (HLE) is of great importance for developing and maintaining early reading skills; however, little is known about changes in HLE during COVID-19.  Method Across five English-speaking countries, 1,411 families with 2,412 children (ages 0-11; 92% White) responded to an online questionnaire characterizing their HLE before and since COVID-19 restrictions. The researcher-developed questionnaire included items on home literacy resources, enrichment activities, and reading at home behaviors, as well as background information on the families. Almost half of all families (n=709; 50%) indicated having a family member with at least one area of learning difficulty.  Results Ordinal logistic regression showed decreases in physical books as well as increases in digital materials, enrichments activities, and (shared) reading at home. These changes depended on child age, type of COVID-19 restrictions, family history of learning difficulties, and employment changes, but not on SES or the number of adults at home. Families with a history of learning difficulties reported spending less time on shared and independent reading, with greater decreases since COVID-19. Conclusion Our results highlight important environmental factors that can affect educational outcomes and inform the development of policies around literacy practices and interventions aimed to minimize the long-term impact of school closures (e.g., related to public health recommendations, natural catathrophes, extended summer breaks or teacher strikes)."

We investigated individual-level variables associated with self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness to longer-term meditation training. This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) and includes 90 healthy older adults (65-84 years) that were randomised to an 18-month meditation training or a non-native language (English) training. Responsiveness was measured post-intervention using participants’ and teachers’ ratings of four psychological domains (connection, positive/negative emotions, meta-awareness) in relation to two contexts (during sessions, in daily life), teachers’ perception of overall benefit, and a global composite comprising all self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness measures. Linear regression modelling indicates that, when including baseline variables (sex, education, neuroticism, cognition, expectancy) and engagement (hours of formal practice during intervention), only higher levels of engagement were associated with higher global composite scores (standardised estimate=0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77, p&lt;0.001). Global composite scores were not correlated with pre-post changes in well-being. Findings indicate that more time spent practising meditation was related to greater perceived intervention effects.

Zentral ist hierbei die Fragestellung, wie bedürfnisorientierte Mobilitätslösungen die Zufrie-denheit und Attraktivität des öffentlichen Personennahverkehrs, insbesondere außerhalb der Hauptverkehrszeiten, steigern können. Als innovatives Angebot ergänzt Lümo den traditionel-len öffentlichen Linienverkehr in Lübeck und verbindet die Flexibilität des eigenen Autos mit den Vorteilen des öffentlichen Nahverkehrs. Bei der Weiterentwicklung des Ridepooling-An-gebots in Lübeck steht primär die Berücksichtigung von Bedürfnissen wie dem Gefühl von Autonomie, Verbundenheit und Sicherheit im Vordergrund. Um diese Aspekte in der Mobilität messbar und quantifizierbar zu machen, wurde die Skala ""Perceived Mobility Need Satisfac-tion"" (PMNS) entwickelt. Die Ergebnisse einer umfangreichen Panelstudie zeigen, dass Ange-bote von On-Demand-Ridepooling wie Lümo in Bedürfnisbereichen wie Autonomie, Sicher-heit und Vergnügen, die Lücke zwischen dem privaten PKW und dem traditionellen Linienver-kehr schließen können. Damit kann einerseits der Weg geebnet sein für einen Verzicht auf den motorisierten Individualverkehr, und andererseits für den Umstieg auf öffentliche Verkehrsmit-tel.

Here we asked whether such a selective application of Bayesian analyses to only non-significant effects of foregoing frequentist analyses creates bias. In two simulation studies we observed that such selective application of Bayesian analyses in fact severely overestimates evidence in favor of the null hypotheses, when a true population effect exists. While this bias can be attenuated by using more informative priors in the Bayesian analyses, we recommend to not apply such selective combination of analytical approaches but instead to use either frequentist or Bayesian analyses consistently."

Zentral ist hierbei die Fragestellung, wie bedürfnisorientierte Mobilitätslösungen die Zufrie-denheit und Attraktivität des öffentlichen Personennahverkehrs, insbesondere außerhalb der Hauptverkehrszeiten, steigern können. Als innovatives Angebot ergänzt Lümo den traditionel-len öffentlichen Linienverkehr in Lübeck und verbindet die Flexibilität des eigenen Autos mit den Vorteilen des öffentlichen Nahverkehrs. Bei der Weiterentwicklung des Ridepooling-An-gebots in Lübeck steht primär die Berücksichtigung von Bedürfnissen wie dem Gefühl von Autonomie, Verbundenheit und Sicherheit im Vordergrund. Um diese Aspekte in der Mobilität messbar und quantifizierbar zu machen, wurde die Skala ""Perceived Mobility Need Satisfac-tion"" (PMNS) entwickelt. Die Ergebnisse einer umfangreichen Panelstudie zeigen, dass Ange-bote von On-Demand-Ridepooling wie Lümo in Bedürfnisbereichen wie Autonomie, Sicher-heit und Vergnügen, die Lücke zwischen dem privaten PKW und dem traditionellen Linienver-kehr schließen können. Damit kann einerseits der Weg geebnet sein für einen Verzicht auf den motorisierten Individualverkehr, und andererseits für den Umstieg auf öffentliche Verkehrsmit-tel. Zusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass der On-Demand-Ridepooling-Verkehr eine viel-versprechende Ergänzung zum traditionellen Linienverkehr bietet und eine bedürfnisorientierte Weiterentwicklung dieses Angebots eine Schlüsselrolle der nachhaltigen Mobilitätswende spie-len kann."

Examining predictors of self- and teacher-perceived effects of an 18-month randomised controlled trial,"Marco Schlosser, Stefano Poletti, Fabienne Collette, Natalie L. Marchant, Antoine Lutz","Understanding the factors that predict why some individuals perceive to respond more to meditation training than others could impact the development, efficacy, adherence levels, and implementation of meditation-based interventions. We investigated individual-level variables associated with self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness to longer-term meditation training. This study presents a secondary analysis of the Age-Well trial (NCT02977819) and includes 90 healthy older adults (65-84 years) that were randomised to an 18-month meditation training or a non-native language (English) training. Responsiveness was measured post-intervention using participants’ and teachers’ ratings of four psychological domains (connection, positive/negative emotions, meta-awareness) in relation to two contexts (during sessions, in daily life), teachers’ perception of overall benefit, and a global composite comprising all self- and teacher-perceived responsiveness measures. Linear regression modelling indicates that, when including baseline variables (sex, education, neuroticism, cognition, expectancy) and engagement (hours of formal practice during intervention), only higher levels of engagement were associated with higher global composite scores (standardised estimate=0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77, p&lt;0.001). Global composite scores were not correlated with pre-post changes in well-being. Findings indicate that more time spent practising meditation was related to greater perceived intervention effects. We suggest that future studies closely monitor levels of engagement and map reasons for disengagement."

Anecdote, theory, and emerging research suggest that itch experience is different in autistic people, with negative consequences. To address this, an online survey was completed by participants who self-categorised as diagnosed autistic (n=158), suspected autistic (n=37) or not autistic (n=85). We asked about three categories of itch: spontaneous, provoked, and itch caused by a medical condition, with questions focussed on severity, timing and duration, and impact on daily activities such as sleep. Across all categories of itch there was a pattern of greater severity, duration, and impact in diagnosed autistic people compared to non-autistic people, with large effect-size differences for spontaneous and provoked categories. Those with suspected autism largely fell between groups. Regression models showed itch severity associated with self-reported autistic traits. As expected, we found more dermatitis-related itch sufferers in autistic respondents. However, medical itch did not drive differences in spontaneous and provoked itch. Findings therefore suggest that the self-reported itch experience of autistic people is quantifiably more severe, longer lasting and of greater daily relevance, and that these differences cannot be attributed to the higher prevalence of skin dermatitis found in autism. Future studies are required to understand how itch experience fits into the broader picture of sensory differences, to understand mechanisms, and to develop management strategies for what can be a highly morbid experience."
