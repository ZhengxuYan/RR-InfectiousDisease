years, ion-selective electrodes (ises) have become routine means of analysis for industrial, environmental, and clinical applications, allowing for rapid, non-invasive, and easy disease monitoring and diagnostics. their enormous advantages include wide dynamic range, ease of operation and low detector cost. sets of ion-selective electrodes selective towards various ions can easily be assembled into an electronic tongue system. the additional information gained from other electrodes can help overcome the ise\u2019s inherent limitations, such as the need for recalibration in more complex samples of variable ionic strength. in this work we developed low-cost ion-selective electrodes made from disposable syringes equipped with plasticized pvc membranes. to characterize the system we have chosen well-studied ionophore valinomycin, and the results in model solutions were comparable to standard ise electrodes fabricated using commercial bodies. however, quantification of potassium in real samples showed, as expected, that measurement in complex, more concentrated solutions of higher ionic strength, such as beetroot soup, tomato-based food products, and dried fruits, are reproducible but subject to relative error up to 76 %. to overcome this limitation, we have constructed an electronic tongue based on the low-cost syringe electrodes. different compositions of the array were tested with a series of multivariate algorithms. we have shown that adding a single type of electrode coupled with an ensemble random forest model allows us to quantify potassium in a wide range of food products, and pharmaceutical supplements without recalibration. compared to a quantification of potassium using a standard calibration curve, the root mean square error of prediction was almost six times lower. we have also shown how the array can be designed to achieve comparable analytical performance using less selec-tive ionophores, such as dibenzo-18-crown-6 instead of valinomycin."},

close this gap. three ionic liquids with substituted pyridinium cations are considered. we provide large enough data sets (123 - 158 compounds) that can be used in further works devoted to qsrr and related methods. we provide a qsrr study using this data set and demonstrate the following. the retention index for a polyethylene glycol stationary phase (denoted as ripeg), predicted using another model, can be used as a molecular descriptor. the use of this descriptor significantly improves the accuracy of the qsrr model. both deep learning-based and linear models were considered for ripeg

model accuracy. these facts have to be considered in order to avoid misleading conclusions. for the qsrr research, we developed a software tool with a graphical user interface, which we called chereshnya. it is intended to select molecular descriptors and construct linear equations connecting molecular descriptors with gas chromatographic retention indices for any stationary phase. the

blood-brain barrier, drugs do not easily reach the target area in the brain. although conventional screening methods for drug discovery involve the measurement of (unbound fraction of drug) brain-to-plasma partition coefficients, it is difficult to consider non-equilibrium between plasma and brain compound concentration-time profiles. to truly understand the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of cns drugs, compound concentration-time profiles in the brain are necessary; however, such analyses are costly, time consuming, and require a significant number of animals. therefore, in this study, we attempted to develop an in silico prediction method that does not require a large amount of experimental data by combining modeling and simulation (m&s) with machine learning (ml). first, we constructed a hybrid model linking plasma concentration-time profile to the brain compartment that takes into account the transit time and brain distribution of each compound. using mouse plasma and brain time experimental values for 103 compounds, we determined the brain kinetic parameters of the hybrid model for each compound; this case was defined as scenario i (a positive control experiment) and included the full brain concentration-time profile data. next, we built an ml model using chemical structure descriptors as explanatory variables and rate parameters as the target variable, and we then input the predicted values from 5-fold cross-validation (cv) into the hybrid model; this case was defined as scenario ii, in which no brain compound concentration-time profile data exist. finally, for scenario iii, assuming that the brain concentration is obtained at only one time point, we used the brain kinetic parameters from the result of the 5-fold cv in scenario ii as the initial values for the hybrid model and performed parameter re-fitting against the observed brain concentration at that time point. as a result, the rmse/r2-values of the brain compound concentration-time profiles over time were 0.445/0.517 in scenario ii and 0.246/0.805 in scenario iii, indicating the method provides high accuracy and suggesting that it is a

gearing systems are technomimetic nanoscale analogues to complex geared machinery in the macroscopic world and are likewise defined as systems incorporating intermeshed elements which perform

further progress in this endeavor will pave the way for unidirectional molecular gearing devices with a distinct type of molecular machine awaiting its realization. within this work an essential step towards this goal is achieved by evidencing directional biases for the light-induced rotations in molecular photogear system 1. using a custom-designed led-coupled chiral cryo-hplc setup for the

Lewis", "Abstract": "organohalogen compounds are extensively used as building blocks, intermediates, pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals due to their unique chemical and biological properties. installing halogen substituents, however, frequently requires functionalized starting materials and multistep functional group interconversion. several classes of halogenases evolved in nature to enable halogenation of a different classes of substrates; for example, site-selective halogenation of electron rich aromatic compounds is catalyzed by flavin-dependent halogenases (fdhs). mechanistic studies have shown that these enzymes use fadh2 supplied by a flavin reductase (fred) to reduce o2 to water with concomitant oxidation of x- to hox (x = cl, br, i). this species travels through a tunnel within the enzyme to access the fdh active site. here, it is believed to h-bond to an active site lysine proximal to bound substrate, enabling electrophilic halogenation with selectivity imparted via molecular recognition, rather than directing groups or strong electronic activation.  the unique selectivity of fdhs led to several early biocatalysis efforts, preparative halogenation was rare, and the hallmark catalyst-controlled selectivity of fdhs did not translate to non-native substrates. fdh engineering was limited to site-directed mutagenesis, which resulted in modest changes in site-selectivity or substrate preference. to address these limitations, we optimized expression conditions for the fdh rebh and its cognate fred, rebf. we then showed that rebh could be used for preparative halogenation of non-native substrates with catalyst-controlled selectivity. we reported the first examples in which the stability, substrate scope, and site selectivity of an fdh were improved to synthetically useful levels via directed evolution. x-ray crystal structures of evolved fdhs and reversion mutations showed that random mutations throughout the rebh structure were critical to achieving high levels of activity and selectivity on diverse aromatic substrates, and these data were used in combination with molecular dynamics simulations to develop predictive model for fdh selectivity. finally, we used family-wide genome mining to identify a diverse set of fdhs with novel substrate scope and complementary regioselectivity on large, three-dimensionally complex compounds.  the diversity of our evolved and mined fdhs allowed us to pursue synthetic applications beyond simple aromatic halogenation. for example, we established that fdhs catalyze enantioselective reactions involving desymmetrization, atroposelective halogenation, and halocyclization. these results highlight the ability of fdh active sites to tolerate different substrate topologies. this utility was further expanded by our recent studies on the single component fdh/fred, aetf. while we were initially drawn to aetf because it does not require a separate fred, we found that it halogenates substrates that are not halogenated efficiently or at all by other fdhs and provides high enantioselectivity for reactions that could only be achieved using rebh variants after extensive mutagenesis. perhaps most notably, aetf catalyzes site-selective aromatic iodination and enantioselective iodoetherification. together, these studies highlight the origins of fdh engineering, the utility and limitations of the enzymes developed to date, and the promise of fdhs for an ever-expanding range of biocatalytic halogenation reactions."}, {"Link/DOI":

comparative crystallographic analysis, within the broader context of a curated dataset of 50 dac-containing molecules, retrieved from the literature, and their corresponding crystal packing. we uncover that the dac moiety leverages its pronounced local dipole moment and inherently planar configuration to facilitate different modes of \u03c0-stacking interaction. these are strongly directed by c-h\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7o interactions between the coumarin carbonyl group with the ethyl-residue or the 3-substituent of adjacent molecules. in solution, the presence of a 7-diethylamino group is shown to enhance solubility through its conformational flexibility, while in the crystalline matrix it primarily acts as a structural spacer that favors \u03c0-stacking interactions. our findings present a comprehensive analysis of the preferential arrangements of the dac fragment in various (supra)molecular scenarios, including cases where its influence is overridden. we thus present the

Arges", "Abstract": "reducing the cost of hydrogen transport is an important priority for proliferation of clean hydrogen to decarbonize various sectors of industry and heavy-duty vehicle transportation. pipeline transport of gases is the lowest cost delivery method for gases over long distances, but there are only a few pipeline networks dedicated to hydrogen. it is possible to alleviate clean hydrogen transportation costs by delivering it via existing natural gas pipeline infrastructures. this strategy, however, necessitates dilution of hydrogen by blending it with natural gas as the hydrogen can embrittle existing pipeline materials. an electrochemical hydrogen pump (ehp) is a separation platform capable of de-blending hydrogen from natural gas mixtures at end use locations because many applications require purified hydrogen. in this work, we deploy high-temperature polymer electrolyte membrane (ht-pem) ehps to purify hydrogen from dilute hydrogen-natural gas mixtures (i.e., 5 to 20 vol% hydrogen). the ht-pem ehp uses an ion-pair ht-pem with perfluorosulfonic acid-phosphonic acid ionomer blends as electrode binders. interestingly, we observe that activation overpotentials govern ht-pem ehp polarization when feeding dilute hydrogen mixtures. we ascribe this observation to interfacial mass transfer resistance of hydrogen through the ionomer binder to the electrocatalyst surface resulting in a lower surface concentration of hydrogen and a lower exchange current density. pressurizing the anode to 1.76 barabs ameliorates the interfacial mass transfer resistance and enabled us to achieve an ehp limiting current of 1.4 a cm-2 with a 10 vol% of hydrogen in natural gas feed. this configuration also pressurized the hydrogen at the cathode to 2.51 barabs. the ht-pem ehp showed a small degradation rate, 44 \u00b5v h-1, during a 100-hour durability test purifying 10 vol% hydrogen-natural gas feed mixtures to 99.3 vol% hydrogen."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-jmgjk-v2", "Publication Date": "2024-03-18 00:00:00", "Title": "non-bonded force field parameters from mbis partitioning of the molecular electron density improve binding affinity predictions of the t4-lysozyme double mutant", "Probability": "0.90538895", "Authors": "Luis  Macaya Duv\u00e1n  Gonz\u00e1lez Esteban  V\u00f6hringer-Martinez", "Abstract": "binding affinity prediction using computer simulation has been increasingly incorporated in drug discovery projects. its wide application, however, is limited by the prediction accuracy of the free energy calculations. the main error sources are force fields used to describe molecular interactions and incomplete sampling of the configurational space. to improve the quality of the force field, we developed a python-based computational workflow. the workflow described here uses the minimal basis iterative stockholder method (mbis) to determine atomic charges and lennard-jones parameters from the polarized molecular density. this is done by performing electronic structure calculations on various configurations of the ligand, both when it is bound and unbound. in addition, we have validated a simulation procedure that accounts for the protein and the ligand degrees of freedom to precisely calculate binding free energies. this was achieved by comparing the self-adjusted mixture sampling and non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration methods using various protein and ligand conformations. the accuracy of predicting binding affinity is improved by using mbis derived force field parameters and the validated simulation procedure. this improvement surpasses the chemical precision for the eight aromatic ligands reaching a root mean square error (rmse) of 0.7 kcal/mol.

applications in organic chemistry", "Probability": "0.87470424", "Authors": "Lung-Yi Chen Yi-Pei Li", "Abstract": "this paper presents autotemplate, an innovative data preprocessing protocol, addressing the crucial need for high-quality chemical reaction datasets in the realm of machine learning applications in organic chemistry. recent advances in artificial intelligence have expanded the application of machine learning in chemistry, particularly in yield prediction, retrosynthesis, and reaction condition prediction. however, the effectiveness of these models hinges on the integrity of chemical reaction datasets, which are often plagued by inconsistencies like missing reactants, incorrect atom mappings, and outright erroneous reactions. autotemplate introduces a twostage approach to refine these datasets. the first stage involves extracting meaningful reaction transformation rules and formulating generic reaction templates using a simplified smarts representation. this simplification broadens the applicability of templates across various chemical reactions. the second stage is template-guided reaction verification, where these templates are systematically applied to validate and correct the reaction data. this process effectively amends missing reactant information, rectifies atom-mapping errors, and eliminates incorrect data entries. a standout feature of autotemplate is its capability to concurrently identify and correct false chemical reactions. it operates on the premise that most reactions in datasets are accurate, using these as templates to guide the correction of flawed entries. the protocol demonstrates its efficacy across a range of chemical reactions, significantly enhancing dataset quality. this advancement provides a more robust foundation for developing reliable machine learning models in chemistry, thereby improving the accuracy of forward and retrosynthetic predictions. autotemplate marks a significant progression in the preprocessing of chemical reaction datasets, bridging a vital gap and facilitating more precise and efficient machine learning applications in organic synthesis. scientific contribution: the proposed automated preprocessing tool for chemical reaction data aims to identify errors within chemical databases. specifically, if the errors involve atom mapping or the absence of reactant types, corrections can be systematically applied using reaction templates, ultimately elevating the overall quality of the database."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-vgzp3",

the qm/mm trajectory. an appropriate healing time should be as short as possible (to avoid unnecessary computational effort), but long enough to equilibrate to the qm/mm ground state distribution. healing times in previous studies range from tens of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds, suggesting the need for guidelines to choose a healing time.  we examine the effect of healing trajectory length on the nonadiabatic dynamics and spectrum of a first-generation donor-acceptor stenhouse adduct in chloroform. insufficient healing times skew the branching ratio of relaxation back to the

dft labels directly from the atomic structure. the chemical environments learned by the gnn lead to capturing composition-structure-property relationships for the orr/oer activity and selectivity. active learning facilitates the investigation of the search space by balancing the exploration of unseen atomic structures with the exploitation of the active ones. the computational predictions of promising co-fe, co-co, and co-zn metal pairs are consistent with the state-of-the-art results of experimental measurements reported in the literature. the gnn-based analysis of multiple active sites

essential for nearly all strategies to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming to 2\u00b0c by 2100. cdr must capture co2 from air and safely sequester it. mg-rich silicate minerals have the capacity to remove ~10^5 gton co2 and sequester it in the form of stable and innocuous carbonate minerals or dissolved bicarbonate ions, but their reaction rates under ambient conditions are far too slow for practical and scalable cdr. here we show that cao reacts quantitatively with diverse mg silicates (olivine, serpentine, augite) under thermochemical conditions to form ca2sio4 and mgo. upon exposure to ambient air under wet conditions, ca2sio4 is quantitatively converted to caco3 and sio2, and mgo is partially converted into a mg carbonate within weeks, while the input mg silicate shows no reactivity over 6 months. the mixture of ca2sio4, and mgo can also be completely carbonated to caco3 and mg(hco3)2 under 1 atm co2 at ambient temperature within hours. by combining it with caco3 calcination to generate cao, this chemistry enables a new process for cdr wherein the output ca2sio4/mgo material is used to remove co2 from air or soil to form stable (bi)carbonates and the co2 process emissions are sequestered. analysis of the energy requirements indicates that this process could provide cdr at less than 1 mwh per ton co2 removed, approximately half the energy required just to capture co2 with leading direct air capture technologies. we also demonstrate analogous transformations using caso4 as the cao source. the chemistry described here

chemistry, coined as \u201cescaping from flatland\u201d, have led to a greater focus on accessing highly functionalized c(sp3)-rich amines to improve the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of compounds. this communication presents a modular and operationally straightforward three-component alkyl petasis boron-mannich (apbm) reaction that utilizes ubiquitous starting materials, including amines, aldehydes and alkyl boronates. overcoming the long-standing synthetic hurdle of accomplishing the petasis boron-mannich reaction with alkyl boronate coupling partners was achieved via the formation of an electron donor-acceptor (eda) complex and sequential radical-radical coupling. by adapting this transformation to high-throughput experimentation (hte), it offers rapid access to an array of diverse c(sp3)-rich complex amines, amenable for facile drug candidate development."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-jphgm", "Publication Date": "2024-03-11 00:00:00",

"this study investigates the role of fine particles in stabilizing emulsion in the naphthenic froth treatment (nft) process. the characterization results of different types of solids collected from the diluted bitumen froth indicate that kaolinite is the dominant clay mineral in the composition of nft solids. there were differences in the mineralogy of the fine samples depending on the phase (carrier fluid) from which the samples were collected. ftir analysis shows that the fines that remain in the diluted bitumen even after several hours of sample retention time are mainly kaolinite, though the presence of other minerals such as siderite is very likely. moreover, the presence of organic functional groups on the surface of the particles is confirmed for all types of solids in the ftir analysis, regardless of the washing and drying procedures employed. inspection of the different layers of the diluted bitumen via micrography and measurement of the solids concentration shows higher fine content and smaller particles in the top layer, a dire situation for destabilizing the emulsion in the top layer, supported by the observation that the water droplets in this layer are tiny. solid partitioning tests revealed the solid particles migrate to the interfacial region and the aqueous phase. the concentration of particles increased in the interfacial region with the presence of asphaltene in the oil phase (dominant effect) and the increased polarity of the oil. the wettability measurements show that without the coverage of solid particles with organics (asphaltene-resin molecules), the fine particles are extremely hydrophilic. the adsorption of asphaltene-resin matter on the fine particles increased the hydrophobicity of the fines, a situation that promotes the partitioning of the fine particles at the interfacial region and the stability of the droplets. it was observed that the contact angle increased with the decreasing polarity of the oil phase. in the interfacial tension measurements, the fine solids with minimal asphaltic matter coverage did not remain suspended in the oil phase and either sedimented rapidly or migrated to the air-oil interface, unlike the organics-covered solids which remained immersed in oil. no decrease in the interfacial tension was recorded for the water-oil systems in the presence of fine solids. interfacial rheology measurements illustrate the viscoelastic behavior of the interfacial film at lower frequencies and higher fine particle concentrations. we conclude that if not for the interaction between the asphaltic matter and the fine particles, the emulsion stability by fine particles would have been very unlikely.

tcid, then feeding a new racemic suspension into the enriched suspension and applying temperature cycles. by leaving a highly enriched crystalline phase as seed crystals to direct the chirality of the following enrichment, the enrichment process was significantly accelerated, verifying the stable and high production efficiency. furthermore, from the perspective of process productivity, the moderate suspension density is optimal for efficient deracemization. in the naphthamide system, up to 7.71 g\u00b7l\u22121\u00b7h\u22121 of the productivity was achieved. thanks to the simple operation, the

a critical technology for enhancing the energy efficiency for the co2 reduction reaction (co2rr) because a thin electrolyte layer can effectively reduce the ohmic resistance. the stable operation of the co2rr in mea-based cells with an anion-exchange membrane (aem), however, is hindered by the accumulation of bicarbonate salts, which are derived from alkali-metal cations in anolytes, on the cathode side. therefore, for stable operation of co2 electrolysis using an mea-based cell, the amount of alkali-metal cations needs to be reduced. however, the minimal amount of alkali-metal cations required to operate the reaction system has not been elucidated. quantitative analysis of the amount of alkali-metal cations transported from the anode to the cathode is essential to obtain the insight into the necessary amount for the operation. in this study, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the production of high-value c2+ compounds, such as ethylene and ethanol, and the transported alkali-metal cations. as a result, although the presence of transported alkali-metal cations on the cathode surface significantly contributes to the generation of c2+ compounds, the rate of k+ ion transport did not match the selectivity of c2+. this result suggests a continuous supply of high amount of k+ to the cathode surface is not required for c2+ formation. on the basis of these findings, we achieved a faradaic efficiency (fe) and a partial current density for c2+ of 77% and 230 ma cm\u22122, respectively, even after switching the anode solution from 0.1 m khco3 to a dilute k+ solution (<7 mm) in an mea-based cell using aem and cu nanoparticles as the cathode catalyst. these values of fe and partial current density were almost identical to those when 0.1 m khco3 was continuously supplied as the anode solution. based on this insight, we successfully improved the durability of the system against salt precipitation. the fe for ethylene remained constant for as long as 60 h at 150 ma cm\u22122 when continuously flowing 0.1 m khco3 as anolyte. however, the fe suddenly decreased after 60 h due to the cessation of co2 gas flow, caused by salt

agglomeration. this research focuses on the heat and mass transfer as well as the reaction mechanism within the al@ap propellant through molecular modeling. the direct contact between the metal fuel and oxidizer leads to an immediate redox reaction at the corresponding interface, facilitating the diffusion of oxygen atoms from surrounding ap molecules into the al particles. heat is transferred from the al particles to the surrounding oxidizer, instead of inward heat transfer from the ap-htpb interface as observed in the conventional al/ap composite. this novel assembly method significantly accelerates the reaction rate, more than doubling that of the conventional al/ap composite. moreover, two extreme pressure conditions (e.g., condensed phase vs. vacuum) are considered to examine the pressure effect on the combustion process of micro-unit composite fuel. the simulation results demonstrate that pressure has a negligible effect on the rapid combustion stage of burning al particles, as it is primarily governed by the diffusion mechanism. under vacuum conditions, the reaction products of propellants drive the burning al in the gas flow, leading to the detachment of the metal fuel from the oxidizer. the reaction mechanism transitions to surface reactions on al particle with gaseous products. in terms of agglomerations, the coalescence of two burning al droplets is observed to form a larger product owing to the reduced distances within ap particle. the al droplets are almost consumed before coalescence due to the rapid combustion, resulting in no negative impact on the al combustion, as observed in conventional composites. the above findings highlight the unique features of micro-unit composite fuel in the application of solid propellants, and serve as an atomistic

high coordination unsaturation sites. for au nps to act as catalysts, the choice of a suitable support for the desired reaction is essential to ensure homogeneous dispersion of the particles while maintaining their nanosize. as a support material, hydrogels obtained by three-dimensional crosslinking of hydrophilic polymers are suitable dispersants for au nps. in addition, their high affinity for water-rich environments and high biocompatibility have attracted attention for biological and biomedical reactions. however, application in small, confined spaces such as in vivo requires micronization of the hydrogel. here, we have developed a gold catalyst supported on micro-sized dna hydrogels with variable internal crosslinking densities composed of simple dna nanostructures called motifs. the short strand length of the dna motif resulted in dna hydrogel particles with high crosslinking density and au nps with small particle size. furthermore, our micro-sized dna hydrogel particle-supported gold catalyst system sufficiently advanced the model reaction with a very small amount of gold catalyst compared to a gel-supported gold catalyst system with a comparable au np size. the crosslinking density of the dna hydrogel particles, and thus the size of the resulting au nps, can be easily varied and the catalytic activity can be enhanced by increasing the surface area of the hydrogel catalyst support through microparticulation. our findings based on dna nanotechnology suggest that the physical properties of the dna hydrogel particles, such as particle size and

for one week. we demonstrated that the immobilized liposomes could be released from aao pores rapidly and on-demand by only one-minute ultrasonic irradiation while they did not leak spontaneously

multivalent metal cation such as zn2+. in this study, we comprehensively investigate the electrochemical reactivity of two model quinones, chloranil and duroquinone, both when diluted in solution or incorporated into carbon-based composite electrodes. we demonstrate that a common nine-member square scheme proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism can fully describe and rationalize their electrochemical behavior in relation to ph and chemical composition of the aqueous electrolyte. additionally, we emphasize the crucial role played by the pkas associated with the reduced states of quinones in determining the charge carrier involved in compensating negative charges reversibly injected in the active material. finally, contrary to widely reported findings for zn/organic batteries, we unequivocally establish that the predominant solid-state charge carriers in zn2+-based mild aqueous electrolytes are not multivalent zn2+ cations but rather protons supplied by the weakly acidic hexaaqua metal ions (i.e., [zn(h2o)6]2+])."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-phq9f-v2", "Publication Date": "2024-02-28 00:00:00", "Title": "comprehensive polyphenolic profiling

"Abstract": "polyphenols are a broad molecular family whose presence in an organism is mostly only partially known. they are secondary metabolites exhibiting antioxidant properties and are involved in a wide range of biological actions. moreover, polyphenol oxidases, metalloenzymes present in various plants and fungi, play a role in metabolic pathways by catalyzing the hydroxylation and oxidation of polyphenols. functional studies on these enzymes are greatly hampered by the lack of information on the polyphenols present in a specific organism, so the physiological substrate is unknown for most polyphenol oxidases.  therefore, seven commercially available fungal and two plant species were examined in detail for the presence of polyphenols using an lc-hrms-based suspect screening workflow. a total of 401 features were annotated, composed of 221 flavonoids and 180 non-flavonoids. as 64% of the flavonoids were conjugated with a glycone, (semi-)quantification was applied when a reference standard of the aglycone was available. isomers of hesperetin-o-glucoside were ubiquitous in all investigated samples. the samples were then additionally investigated by a quantitative, targeted lc-ms/ms assay that covers 90 polyphenols from 13 distinct polyphenol classes. the targeted assay showed phenolic acids as prevalent analytes. overall, this pilot study provides new insights

endoc-{beta}h1 cells challenged with cytokines. mettl3 silencing in human pseudoislets or endoc-{beta}h1 cells enhanced oas levels by increasing its mrna stability upon cytokine challenge. consistently, in vivo gene therapy, to prolong mettl3 overexpression specifically in {beta}-cells, delayed diabetes progression in the non-obese diabetic (nod) mouse model of t1d by limiting the

efficient and precise surrogate model for high-level electronic structure theory. its application has been limited to closed chemical systems without considering external potentials from the surrounding environments. to address this limitation and incorporate the influence of external potentials, polarization effects, and long-range interactions between a chemical system and its environment, the first two terms of the taylor expansion of an electrostatic operator have been used as extra input to the existing ml model to represent the electrostatic environments. however, high-order electrostatic interaction is often essential to account for external potentials from the environment. the existing models based only on the invariant features cannot capture significant distribution patterns of the external potentials. here, we propose a novel ml model that includes high-order terms of the taylor expansion of an electrostatic operator and uses an equivariant model, which can generate high-order tensors covariant with rotations as a base model. thus, we can use the multipole-expansion equation to derive a useful representation by accounting for the polarization

telomerization of co2 with 1,3-butadiene, is a promising intermediate. however, chemoselective ring-opening polymerization (rop) of evp is hampered by unfavorable thermodynamics and the competitive polymerization of highly reactive c=c double bonds. herein, we report the first chemoselective rop of evp using a phosphazene/urea binary catalyst, affording exclusively a linear unsaturated polyester poly(evp)rop, with a molar mass (mn) up to 6.5 kg\u00b7mol-1 and narrow distribution (\u00f0 = 1.24), which can be fully recycled back to the pristine monomer, thus establishing a monomer-polymer-monomer closed-loop life cycle. remarkably, poly(evp)rop features two pendent c=c double bonds per repeating unit, which show distinct reactivity and thus can be properly engaged in sequential functionalizations towards the synthesis of bifunctional polyesters. this methodology provides a facile access to bifunctional and recyclable polyesters from readily available feedstocks.

"Abstract": "altering the surface stoichiometry of semiconductor electrodes is known to affect the photoelectrochemical (pec) response. to date, several reports have hinted at the influence of the surface bi:v ratio on the solar water oxidation performance of bivo4 photoanodes, but only a handful of strategies have been reported to afford to fine-tune such surface stoichiometry while a comprehensive understanding of an atomic level of the role of the surface termination remains elusive. herein, we report a new methodology that modulates the surface bi:v ratio and, in turn, maximizes the pec performance towards the oxygen evolution reaction (oer). we found that annealing in the presence of ammonium metavanadate drastically reduces the surface recombination while improving the charge separation. detailed characterization revealed that this treatment filled the native surface vanadium vacancies, which are found to act as recombination centers, while inducing a significant increase in the density of oxygen vacancies, which reinforced the built-in electric field that drives the charge separation. interestingly, coating with nifeox improves, especially, the charge separation in surface v-rich bivo4. results suggest that the v-rich surface termination altered the surface energetics of bivo4 leading to an improved band alignment across the interface. overall, these results provide a new platform to modulate the surface stoichiometry of bivo4 thin films while shedding new light on the mechanisms whereby the surface termination governs the pec response."},

"Abstract": "electrooxidation of carbon monoxide (co) and small oxygenate molecules is of great interest for direct alcohol fuel cell (dafc) and electroorganic synthesis.  herein, we demonstrate that carbon-modified silicon oxide (sioxcy) overlayers with nanoscopic thickness can greatly enhance the activity of pt electrodes towards the oxidation of co and five different oxygenate molecules. trends in activity are reported with respect to the composition and structure of the sioxcy overlayers, revealing that low-density, carbon-rich overlayers enhance peak current densities towards the oxidation of formic acid, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, and 1-butanol by 370%, 290%, 190%, 130%, and 30%, respectively, compared to bare pt controls. unlike conventional alloy electrocatalysts, the alcohol oxidation activity of sioxcy|pt electrodes did not strongly correlate with their ability to oxidize co intermediates, suggesting that that c-h bond scission and/or oxidation of aldehyde or carboxylic acid intermediates, rather than co intermediates, are the rate limiting steps during the oxidation of c1 and c2 alcohols. for larger alcohols like propanol and butanol, oxidation activity on encapsulated electrodes diminishes relative to bare pt, which is attributed to mass transport limitations introduced by the overlayer. overall, the structure-property-performance relationships

aluminate garnet (gag) phosphor hosts gd3+xal5-xo12 with 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.60. in these materials, excess gd3+ is accommodated on the octahedrally-coordinated al3+ sublattice of the garnet structure. the most extreme composition gd3.6al4.4o12 has 30% of these al3+ sites substituted by gd3+, but retains the cubic garnet structure type despite the vast size contrast between the two cations. the accessible nonstoichiometry range for gag extends far beyond that of nonstoichiometric yags (y3+xal5-xo12, 0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.4), enabled by a broader glass-forming domain in the gd2o3 \u2013 al2o3 system. we investigate three model phosphor systems based on nonstoichiometric gag, and determine the crystallographic distributions of the dopant ions where possible, to evaluate the response of upconversion and photoluminescence to extreme nonstoichiometry. in particular, upconversion from the small rare-earth activator tm3+ is found to be sensitive to nonstoichiometry in gag. these results demonstrate that highly nonstoichiometric garnet aluminates are not limited to small rare-earth hosts such as yag and should be realizable across the full 4f series, highlighting the potential for color tuning of new upconversion phosphors by control of host stoichiometry and opening new opportunities for development of different garnet-based optical and magnetic materials."},

we introduce a multi-target model, pcmol, that leverages the latent embeddings derived from alphafold as a means of conditioning the de novo generative model on target proteins. it is known that the addition of protein descriptors is an effective strategy to extend the applicability domain and prediction capability of quantitative structure-activity relation (qsar) models, a strategy we refer to

up new possibilities such as interpolation within the chemical space of known highly active compounds and extrapolation on the target side based on their similarities to other proteins, which is especially relevant for understudied or novel targets. our results indicate that pcmol can generate diverse, potentially active molecules for a wide array of proteins, including those with sparse ligand bioactivity data. we also benchmark against existing target-conditioned trans-former models to illustrate the validity of using alphafold protein representations to steer the molecular

starting point towards organic redox flow battery materials. pyridoxal hydrochloride was synthetically converted to a series of diverse vitamin b6-based redox-active benzoyl pyridinium salts. these compounds were electrochemically characterized through cyclic voltammetry (cv) measurements in neutral and basic aqueous electrolytes (1 m kcl and 0.1 m naoh). based on the cv results, which demonstrated reversibility under basic conditions, two of the most promising salts were subjected to laboratory-scale redox flow battery tests involving galvanostatic cycling at 10 mm with 0.1 m naoh as the supporting electrolyte. these results showed that the battery was charged completely, corresponding to the transfer of two electrons to the electrolyte, but no discharge was observed. both cv analysis and electrochemical simulations confirmed that the redox wave observed in the experimental voltammograms corresponds to a two-electron process. to explain the irreversibility in the battery tests, we conducted bulk electrolysis with the benzoyl pyridinium salts, affording the corresponding benzylic secondary alcohols. this process involves the transfer of two electrons and two protons to reduce the ketone group to alcohol. computational studies suggest that the reduction proceeds in three consecutive steps: first electron transfer (et), then proton-coupled electron transfer (pcet) and finally proton transfer (pt). 1h nmr deuterium exchange studies indicated that the last pt step is not reversible in 0.1 m naoh, rendering the entire redox process irreversible. the apparent reversibility observed in cv at the basic media likely arises from the slow rate of the pt step at the timescale of the measurement.

work describes the fabrication of a hydrogen sensor containing -conjugated organic semiconductor based on a n,n-dimethylamine substituted tetraalkynylatedanthracene that can detect h2 at concentrations as low as 150 part per million (ppm) at room temperature. the n,n-dimethyl amine containing tetraalkynylatedanthracene (anphnme2) has been synthesized by tetra-fold sonogashira reaction employing a catalyst system based on pd(ch3cn)2cl2 + catacxium\u00ae a. a precisely con-trolled fabrication is enabled by employing a \u03bc-gridder printing system. the gas sensor shows excellent sensitivity, fast response and high recovery to h2 at room temperature. moreover, after the interaction with h2, the surface electron of the anphnme2 gets enhanced and shows a decrease in the resistance of the fabricated device.  sensor exhibits a limit of detection of 49 ppb with the highest sensitivity of 19.95% for the detection of 900 ppm of h2, with a response time of 10 to 20

in particular, pl2 and pl3 respond differentially to a walker b mutation in either nbd1 or nbd2, as well as to mutations in both. we characterize the conformational dynamics of pore loops and the allosteric paths connecting nbds to pore loops by molecular dynamics simulations and find that both principal motions and allosteric paths can be altered by changing the atpase state of clpb. remarkably, pl3, which is highly conserved in aaa+ machines, is found to favor an upward conformation when only nbd1 undergoes atp hydrolysis, but a downward conformation when nbd2 is active. these results explicitly demonstrate a significant long-range allosteric effect of atp hydrolysis sites on pore-loop dynamics. pore loops are therefore established as active participants that undergo atp-dependent conformational changes to translocate substrate proteins through the central pores of aaa+ machines.  statement of significancemolecular machines function by coupling the energy of atp hydrolysis to mechanical motion. how this coupling occurs and what timescales are involved remains an open question. in this study, we use a powerful single-molecule fret technique to measure the real-time dynamics of pore loops, which are essential protein-translocating elements of the atp-dependent disaggregation machine clpb. using a series of mutations of the atp-hydrolysis motifs of clpb, we find that, although the motions of these pore loops take place on the microsecond time scale, they are markedly affected by the much slower changes in the nucleotide state of the machine. generally, this study shows that protein machines, such as clpb, are wired to harness atp binding and hydrolysis to allosterically affect distal events, such as the function-related mechanics of pore-loops."}, {"Link/DOI": "https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.08.556893", "Publication Date": "2024-01-09 00:00:00", "Title": "elf1 promotes rad26 interaction with lesion-arrested pol ii for transcription-coupled repair", "Probability": "0.97517437", "Authors": "['Sarsam, R.;

vital for fetal development and its contributions to various developmental issues, such as pregnancy complications, fetal growth restriction, and maternal exposure, have been extensively studied in mice. the placenta forms mainly from fetal tissue and therefore has the same biological sex as the fetus it supports. extensive research has delved into the placentas involvement in pregnancy complications and future offspring development, with a notable emphasis on exploring sex-specific disparities. however, despite these investigations, sex-based disparities in epigenetic (e.g., dna methylation) and transcriptomic features of the late-gestation mouse placenta remain largely unknown.  methodswe collected male and female mouse placentas at late gestation (e18.5, n = 3/sex) and performed next-generation sequencing to identify genome-wide sex differences in transcription and dna methylation.  resultsour comparison between male and female revealed 358 differentially expressed genes (degs) on autosomes, which were associated with signaling pathways involved in transmembrane transport and the responses to viruses and external stimuli. x chromosome degs (n = 39) were associated with different pathways, including those regulating chromatin modification and small gtpase-mediated signal transduction. differentially methylated regions (dmrs) were more common on the x chromosomes (n = 3756) than on autosomes (n = 1705). interestingly, while most x chromosome dmrs had higher dna methylation levels in female placentas and tended to be included in cpg dinucleotide-rich regions, 73% of autosomal dmrs had higher methylation levels in male placentas and were distant from cpg-rich regions. several degs were correlated with dmrs. a subset of the dmrs present in late-stage placentas were already established in mid-gestation (e10.5) placentas (n = 348 dmrs on x chromosome and 19 dmrs on autosomes), while others were acquired later in placental development.  conclusionour study provides comprehensive lists of degs and dmrs between male and female that collectively cause profound differences in the dna methylation and gene expression profiles

crucial organ for a healthy pregnancy and proper fetal development, and its functions are often studied in mice. the placenta stems from the developing embryo, and therefore shares its sex. male fetuses have higher risks of pregnancy complications and neurodevelopmental disorders, and these risks are linked to placenta functions. however, how the placentas sex influences the proteins it contains--and therefore, how it helps the fetus develop--remains largely unknown. we used cutting-edge techniques to systematically examine late-pregnancy mouse placentas, cataloging the genes being expressed (i.e., sections of dna used to make proteins) and the patterns of a specific dna mark (called methylation) that controls gene expression. we identified several genes with important placental functions, such as protecting the fetus from viruses and responding to environmental changes, whose expression levels were sex-specific. we also observed differences in dna methylation between male and female placentas. most dna methylation differences were on the x-chromosomes associated with sex, and the majority had higher methylation levels in female placentas. conversely, on other chromosomes, most differences present an increased level of dna methylation in male placentas. as methylation affects gene expression, we found links between the changes. additionally, we found that some sex differences in the placenta were already present earlier in pregnancy. our findings provide important insights into the molecular differences between male and female mouse placentas during late pregnancy. including sex-specific analyses in placenta studies will improve our understanding of how the placenta ensures the healthy development of male and female fetuses."}, {"Link/DOI":
